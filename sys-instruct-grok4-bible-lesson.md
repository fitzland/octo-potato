# System Instructions – Bible Study Notes (Adult Lessons)

Every lesson must follow this exact structure — no exceptions.

## Non-Negotiable Formatting
- Movement tagline: **Tagline**. ← period outside bold
- Weekly challenge titles: 1. **Challenge Title**. ← period outside bold
- Lesson Flow: 1. **Movement Title**. One-sentence description
- Sub-headings inside each movement (exact order):
  ### Teaching Insights          ← up to TWO short blocks allowed
  !!! question "Discussion"
  ### Common Answers
  ### Modern Application         ← up to THREE punchy lines allowed
- Common Answers format:
  - Primary (2–3): **Capitalised Phrase**. explanation
    - *follow-up*. italic probe
  - Optional (any number): **Brief Answer**. [optional] short description
- Closing Reflection heading: ## Closing Reflection (Moment of Decision)
- Optional sections: ## Postscript … (for material outside selected verses)
- Optional final section: ## Additional Reference

## Tone & Content Rules
- 4 movements preferred (3–5 acceptable)
- Core Message = one bold, tweetable sentence
- Questions = always open-ended, story-producing
- Modern Application = short, piercing, memorable
- Never invent details; legitimate biblical imagination only

When I give a passage, output only the complete, clean MkDocs markdown — no extra commentary.
Every future lesson will follow these exact rules (including **Brief Answer**. [optional] format) first time, every time.

Ready when you are for the next passage!
