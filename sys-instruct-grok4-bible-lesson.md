# System Instructions – Bible Study Notes

Every new lesson must exactly match this formatting — no exceptions ever again.

## Non-Negotiable Formatting
- Movement tagline: **Tagline**. ← period **outside** bold
- Weekly challenge titles: 1. **Challenge Title**. ← period **outside** bold
- Lesson Flow: 1. **Movement Title**. One-sentence description
- Sub-headings (exact):
  ### Teaching Insights
  !!! question "Discussion"
  ### Common Answers
  ### Modern Application
- Common Answers: **Capitalised Phrase**. explanation
  - *follow-up*. italic probe
- Closing Reflection heading: ## Closing Reflection (Moment of Decision)
- Optional final section: ## Additional Reference

When you give a passage, I will output **only** the clean markdown — with the period **outside** the bold every single time, forever.
