# Task: Prepare Adult Bible Study Lesson

This document outlines the standard 5-Phase, 11-Step workflow for preparing adult Bible study lessons, designed to be expository and discussion-driven. This process ensures a consistent approach unless specific genre adaptations are required.

All output generated following this task guide must adhere to the formatting rules defined in STYLE-MARKDOWN.md.

## Teaching Philosophy & Assumptions

This lesson framework is built on the following convictions:

- Scripture is authoritative, sufficient, and internally coherent.
- The primary task of teaching is to explain what the text means, not to share opinions.
- Good application flows from sound interpretation.
- Scripture must be allowed to interpret Scripture.
- Lessons should engage the **mind** (understanding), **heart** (formation), and **will** (obedience).
- Discussion serves the text; the text does not serve discussion.

This process intentionally moves from **text → meaning → synthesis → reflection → application**, resisting shortcuts that lead to moralism, proof-texting, or speculation.

---

## Interpretive Guardrails (Non-Negotiables)

All lessons must observe the following guardrails:

- Do **not** build doctrine on:
  - Isolated verses removed from context
  - Narrative description treated as command
  - Symbolic or apocalyptic imagery without clear textual anchors
- Always ask:
  - What did this passage mean to the original audience?
  - How does the broader canon clarify this passage?
- Maintain a clear distinction between:
  - **Interpretation** — What the text means
  - **Reflection** — How the truth penetrates our hearts
  - **Application** — How believers live in light of it
- Avoid:
  - Speculative theology
  - Over-allegorization
  - Applications disconnected from the passage's main idea

---

## Christological Integration Requirement

Every lesson—Old Testament or New Testament—must explicitly address:

> **How does this passage point to Christ, the gospel, or life under the New Covenant?**

This may include:
- Direct messianic fulfillment
- Typology (fulfilled patterns)
- Contrast (law vs. grace)
- Theological trajectory culminating in Christ

Lessons must avoid moralism by anchoring obedience in Christ's finished work and ongoing lordship.

## Critical Distinction: Four Types of Lesson Prompts

This lesson model maintains a sharp distinction between four types of prompts, each with a unique purpose and interaction style, designed to move a learner from understanding to action.

### 1. Discussion Questions (Mind & Community) — For Group Interaction

- **Purpose:** To generate conversation, deepen collective understanding of the text, and explore its implications together. These questions are designed to be answered aloud and foster a shared learning environment.
- **Nature:** Open-ended, analytical, exploratory. They ask "What?", "Why?", and "How?" about the passage's meaning. They should be high-impact, getting to the core of the passage's message.
- **Interaction:** Asked aloud with the clear expectation of group participation and discussion.
- **Placement:** Placed within each major teaching section to unpack the text as you go.

### 2. Reflection Questions (Heart) — For Personal, Silent Introspection

- **Purpose:** To guide learners in privately examining their own hearts, beliefs, and attitudes in light of God's truth. The goal is honest self-assessment before God, free from the pressure of group performance or what others might think.
- **Nature:** Introspective, diagnostic, and personal. Often labeled with `(Heart)`.
- **Interaction:** Asked aloud by the teacher, but explicitly framed as a question for silent thought. The teacher should create a deliberate pause and state that no verbal answer is expected.
- **Placement:** Typically at the end of a teaching section to allow the truth to penetrate personally before moving on.

### 3. Decision Questions (Will) — For Personal Commitment

- **Purpose:** To call learners to make a fundamental, internal choice or commitment in response to the lesson's truth. This is about deciding to align one's will with God's.
- **Nature:** Focuses on heart posture and fundamental choices, not specific behaviors. Often phrased as "Will you...?" or "Are you ready to...?"
- **Interaction:** Primarily rhetorical questions calling for an internal, personal commitment.
- **Placement:** Placed **only** in the `Closing` section.

### 4. Application Challenges (Practice) — For Concrete Action

- **Purpose:** To provide specific, achievable actions that learners can do during the week *as a result of* the decision they have made.
- **Nature:** Behavioral, practical, "to-do" items that flow directly from the lesson.
- **Interaction:** Presented as clear, actionable steps for the week ahead.
- **Placement:** Placed **only** in the `Closing` section, ideally following the Decision questions.

**Why This Matters:** This progression is intentional. **Discussion** builds shared understanding, **Reflection** allows for personal conviction, **Decision** sets the will, and **Application** channels that will into obedient action. Mixing them diffuses focus and diminishes impact.

---

## Core Workflow (Didactic Passages — Default)

This workflow is followed unless the biblical genre requires adaptation.

---

## Phase 1: Method Review (Mindset Alignment)

**Goal:** Establish shared expectations for how the passage will be studied.

- Briefly restate the interpretive approach.
- Note any genre-specific adjustments if required.
- Confirm the passage to be studied and verify it forms a complete thought unit.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational Exegesis (Understanding the Text)

**Goal:** What does this passage actually say and mean?

### Step 1 — Isolate and Read the Text

- Read the full passage in the **Berean Standard Bible (BSB)**.
- Read it multiple times to internalize the flow.
- Observe repeated words, contrasts, transitions, and connectives.
- Note anything that surprises, confuses, or challenges.

### Step 2 — Analyze the Structure

- Identify thought units and rhetorical movement.
- Trace the flow: commands, warnings, reasoning, illustrations, conclusions.
- Ask: How does the author build his argument or develop his theme?
- For didactic texts: Outline the logical progression.

### Step 3 — Conduct a Deep Dive

- **Linguistics:** Examine key original-language terms where meaning is debated or nuanced. Use lexicons and word studies to understand semantic range.
- **Cross-References:** Identify parallel passages and canonical connections. How does this passage interact with the rest of Scripture?
- **Context:** Consider the historical, cultural, and literary context. What problem is being addressed? Who is the audience?

---

## Phase 3: Thematic Synthesis (Defining the Core Message)

**Goal:** What is the central, transferable truth?

### Step 4 — Synthesize the Findings

- Distill the passage into a **Core Message** (single governing idea).
- Express it as a complete, memorable sentence that captures the main truth.
- Ensure it's transferable across time and culture.
- This becomes your lesson's **central axis**—everything else supports or flows from it.

Additionally, create:

- **Lesson Title** — Evocative and memorable, capturing the essence of the passage.
- **Lesson Flow Outline** — Divide the passage into 2-4 major section titles that break down how the Core Message unfolds. Each section should address a distinct aspect or movement in the text.

Example from 1 Samuel 17:
- Core Message: "Confident faith confronts adversity head-on by remembering God's past faithfulness, speaking His promises, and acting boldly in His name to achieve His victory."
- Lesson Title: "David. Faith that Moves with Confidence"
- Lesson Flow:
  1. Paralyzing Challenge (Seeing the Giant)
  2. Confident Testimony (Remembering God)
  3. Victorious Stand (Acting in Faith)

---

## Phase 4: Lesson Architecture (Building the Teaching Flow)

**Goal:** Structure the passage into teachable sections with embedded engagement.

### Step 5 — Design the Lesson Flow

For each of your 2-4 major sections, develop:

**Biblical Text & Insights**
- Quote the relevant verses (BSB)
- Provide "Context & Insights" in bullet format:
  - Explain key terms, cultural background, or theological concepts
  - Use bold labels for each insight point
  - Include brief illustrations or metaphors that clarify meaning
  - Keep explanations concise and accessible

**Discussion Questions**
- Create 1-2 open-ended questions that explore the meaning and implications of the text
- These should deepen understanding and generate conversation
- May include "Common Answers" subsection with anticipated responses

**Reflection (Heart)**
- Include 1-2 personal, introspective questions
- These should help learners examine their own hearts in light of the truth
- Use bold labels to introduce each question
- These are diagnostic, not applicational

**Transition**
- End each section with a brief transition statement that bridges to the next section
- Italicize these for visual distinction

### Step 6 — Develop an Icebreaker

- Create 1-2 opening questions that:
  - Establish relevance and psychological safety
  - Connect life experience to the passage theme
  - Encourage broad participation
- Place in Introduction, **before** presenting the Core Message
- May include brief cultural context or problem statement
- Optional: Contrast worldly approach vs. biblical approach to the topic

### Step 7 — Create Illustrations & Metaphors

- Develop modern scenarios where the passage's principles apply
- Use analogies that clarify (not replace) the text
- Make abstract concepts concrete and relatable
- Embed these in the "Context & Insights" of each section
- Ensure illustrations serve the text, not the other way around

---

## Phase 5: Closing Implementation (Moving to Action)

**Goal:** Call for response through decision and practice.

### Step 8 — Craft Decision Questions (Will)

- Create 1-2 penetrating questions that call for commitment
- Focus on heart posture and fundamental choices, not just behavior
- Frame as direct challenges to the will
- Examples: 
  - "Are you ready to...?"
  - "Is your desire to...?"
  - "Will you trust God to...?"

### Step 9 — Develop Weekly Challenges (Practice)

- Provide 3-4 specific, achievable practices
- Balance internal (journaling, prayer, meditation) and external (action, speech, service)
- Ensure each flows directly from the passage's main idea
- Use bold labels for each challenge
- Emphasize grace-driven effort, not performance
- Include one memory verse with reference and full text

### Step 10 — Write the Closing Prayer

- Reflect the lesson's key confessions, petitions, and praise
- Model Scripture-shaped prayer
- Include:
  - Confession of where we have fallen short
  - Petition for transformation and empowerment
  - Declaration of truth from the passage
- Use multiple paragraphs for clarity
- Write in first person plural ("we," "us," "our")

### Step 11 — Assemble the Final Document

Compile all elements according to the Standard Lesson Document Structure below.

**Key Guidelines:**

1. **Conciseness** — Essential points only; use bullets, tables, and headings
2. **Clarity** — Active voice; short sentences; defined terms
3. **Compelling** — Story, questions, engagement, and calls to action
4. **Completeness** — Include all required elements without redundancy
5. **Theological Integrity** — Scripture-based, verse-cited (BSB)
6. **MkDocs Optimization** — Use compatible Markdown features (YAML frontmatter, admonitions, structured headings)

## Genre Adaptations

The core workflow is adapted based on the biblical genre of the passage. The table below shows how each genre modifies the standard didactic approach.

| Element | Didactic (Default) | Narrative | Poetry / Wisdom | Law | Prophecy / Apocalyptic |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----|------------------------|
| **Structure Analysis** (Step 2) | Logical argument flow | Plot: tension → climax → resolution | Poetic structure, parallelism, emotional arc | Categorize: moral / ceremonial / civil | Pattern: indictment → judgment → hope |
| **Deep Dive Focus** (Step 3) | Key terms & logic | Character arcs & God's actions | Imagery, metaphors, emotions | Historical "why" + Christ fulfillment | Historical crisis + symbolic roots |
| **Core Message** (Step 4) | Explicit proposition | Implicit truth shown in story | Core emotion or wisdom principle | Timeless principle + NT fulfillment | Big-picture theology (sovereignty, endurance, worship) |
| **Application Focus** (Steps 8-9) | Obey the command | Emulate faith / avoid failure | Pray the psalm / shape imagination | Live the principle in Christ | Repent + hope-filled obedience |

### Genre-Specific Guidance

#### Narrative Passages

**What they are:** Stories. This is the most common genre in the Bible (Genesis, historical books, Gospels, Acts).

**Goal:** To reveal God's character, His redemptive plan, and the nature of faith through events, characters, and plot. It *shows* truth in action rather than *stating* it as a proposition.

**Key Adjustments:**

- **Structure (Step 2):** Analyze plot elements. Ask: What is the central conflict? What is the rising action, climax, and resolution? How does this story fit into the larger biblical narrative?
- **Deep Dive (Step 3):** Focus on character analysis. What do their words, actions, and decisions reveal? How does God function as the central character? What are the characters' flaws and strengths?
- **Core Message (Step 4):** The main point is rarely stated directly—it's *demonstrated*. Ask: What does this story reveal about God? About humanity? About faith or sin?
- **Reflection & Application:** Frame around emulation and avoidance. "How is my story like this character's story?" "What faith pattern should I emulate?" "What failure should I avoid?"

#### Poetry & Wisdom Literature

**What they are:** Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes. This genre uses imagery, metaphor, and parallelism to engage the heart and emotions.

**Goal:** To give voice to the full range of human emotion before God and to shape the moral imagination for wise living.

**Key Adjustments:**

- **Structure (Step 2):** Analyze poetic structure. Look for parallelism (repetition, contrast, building). For Psalms, trace the emotional arc: lament → trust → praise.
- **Deep Dive (Step 3):** Explore imagery deeply. Why did the author choose this specific image? What emotions and ideas does it evoke? How does it shape our imagination?
- **Core Message (Step 4):** For Psalms, capture the core emotion and theological vision. For Proverbs, glean a principle for skillful living (not an ironclad promise).
- **Reflection & Application:** Provide frameworks for prayer and formation. "Use this Psalm as a template for your prayers this week." "How can this proverb shape your perspective on relationships?"

#### Law

**What they are:** Legal codes in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

**Goal:** To set Israel apart as a holy nation and structure their relationship with a holy God and with each other.

**Key Adjustments:**

- **Structure (Step 2):** Categorize the law. Is it civil (governing society), ceremonial (worship/purity), or moral (God's timeless character)?
- **Deep Dive (Step 3):** Uncover the "why." Why was this law given? What does it reveal about God's holiness, justice, or mercy? What specific cultural context does it address?
- **Core Message (Step 4):** This is critical. Find the underlying principle, then bridge to Christ. Ask: (1) What is the timeless principle? (2) How does Christ fulfill, transform, or embody this principle?
- **Reflection & Application:** Apply the principle, not the letter. We don't obey the literal command (sacrifices), but live out the principle in a New Covenant context (Christ is our ultimate sacrifice; therefore, we offer ourselves as living sacrifices).

#### Prophecy & Apocalyptic Literature

**What they are:** Messages of the prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos) and visionary writings (Daniel, Revelation).

**Goal:** To call God's people to repentance and faithfulness by revealing the consequences of sin and the hope of God's future restoration. Apocalyptic literature uses vivid, symbolic visions to encourage suffering believers.

**Key Adjustments:**

- **Structure (Step 2):** Identify the prophetic pattern: (1) Indictment (What is the sin?), (2) Judgment (What is the coming consequence?), (3) Hope (What is the promise of restoration?).
- **Deep Dive (Step 3):** Historical context is paramount. Who was the prophet? Who was he speaking to? What was the specific political and spiritual crisis? For apocalyptic, trace Old Testament roots of the symbols.
- **Core Message (Step 4):** Focus on the big-picture theology. Don't get lost decoding every symbol. Ask: What is the main theological message? (e.g., "God is sovereign over history," "Jesus is worthy of worship," "Endurance will be vindicated").
- **Reflection & Application:** Two-fold response: (1) How does the prophet's call against injustice or idolatry speak to our world today? (2) How does the ultimate hope revealed in this passage encourage us to live faithfully and worshipfully right now?

## Final Reminders

- The text drives the lesson; the lesson does not drive the text.
- Every lesson must explicitly connect to Christ and the gospel.
- Reflection questions engage the heart *during* teaching; application questions call for action *at the end*.
- Discussion serves understanding; understanding serves obedience.
- Grace-driven transformation, not moralistic performance, is the goal.
