# Task: Prepare Adult Bible Study Lesson

This document outlines the standard 5-Phase, 10-Step workflow for preparing adult Bible study lessons, designed to be expository and discussion-driven. This process ensures a consistent approach unless specific genre adaptations are required.

All output generated following this task guide must adhere to the formatting rules defined in [STYLE-MARKDOWN.md](./STYLE-MARKDOWN.md).

## Teaching Philosophy & Assumptions

This lesson framework is built on the following convictions:

- Scripture is authoritative, sufficient, and internally coherent.
- The primary task of teaching is to explain what the text means, not to share opinions.
- Good application flows from sound interpretation.
- Scripture must be allowed to interpret Scripture.
- Lessons should engage the **mind** (understanding), **heart** (formation), and **will** (obedience).
- Discussion serves the text; the text does not serve discussion.

This process intentionally moves from **text → meaning → synthesis → application → action**, resisting shortcuts that lead to moralism, proof-texting, or speculation.

---

## Interpretive Guardrails (Non-Negotiables)

All lessons must observe the following guardrails:

- Do **not** build doctrine on:
  - Isolated verses removed from context
  - Narrative description treated as command
  - Symbolic or apocalyptic imagery without clear textual anchors
- Always ask:
  - What did this passage mean to the original audience?
  - How does the broader canon clarify this passage?
- Maintain a clear distinction between:
  - **Interpretation** — What the text means
  - **Application** — How believers live in light of it
- Avoid:
  - Speculative theology
  - Over-allegorization
  - Applications disconnected from the passage’s main idea

---

## Christological Integration Requirement

Every lesson—Old Testament or New Testament—must explicitly address:

> **How does this passage point to Christ, the gospel, or life under the New Covenant?**

This may include:
- Direct messianic fulfillment
- Typology (fulfilled patterns)
- Contrast (law vs. grace)
- Theological trajectory culminating in Christ

Lessons must avoid moralism by anchoring obedience in Christ’s finished work and ongoing lordship.

## Core Workflow (Didactic Passages – Default)

This workflow is followed unless the biblical genre requires adaptation.

---

## Phase 1: Method Review (Mindset Alignment)

**Goal:** Establish shared expectations for how the passage will be studied.

- Briefly restate the interpretive approach.
- Note any genre-specific adjustments if required.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational Exegesis (Understanding the Text)

**Goal:** What does this passage actually say and mean?

### Step 1 — Isolate and Read the Text
- Read the full passage in the **Berean Standard Bible (BSB)**.
- Observe repeated words, contrasts, and transitions.

### Step 2 — Analyze the Structure
- Identify thought units and rhetorical movement.
- Trace the flow: commands, warnings, reasoning, illustrations, conclusions.

### Step 3 — Conduct a Deep Dive
- **Linguistics:** Examine key original-language terms where meaning is debated or nuanced.
- **Cross-References:** Identify parallel passages and canonical connections.

---

## Phase 3: Thematic Synthesis (Defining the Core Message)

**Goal:** What is the central, transferable truth?

### Step 4 — Synthesize the Findings

- Distill the passage into a **Core Message** (single governing idea)
- Express it as a complete sentence that captures the main truth
- Ensure it's memorable and transferable
- This becomes your lesson's **central axis**

Additionally, create:
- **Lesson Title** — Evocative, capturing the essence
- **Lesson Flow Outline** — 2-4 major section titles that break down how the Core Message unfolds in the passage

---

## Phase 4: Lesson Architecture (Building the Teaching Flow)

**Goal:** Structure the passage into teachable sections with embedded engagement.

### Step 5 — Design the Lesson Flow
- Divide the passage into 2-4 major teaching sections
- Each section should have:
  - **Biblical Text** (with Context & Insights)
  - **Discussion Questions** (exploring meaning/implications)
  - **Reflection (Heart)** (personal, introspective questions)
- Order sections to build toward the core message

### Step 6 — Develop an Icebreaker
- Create 1-2 opening questions that:
  - Establish relevance and psychological safety
  - Connect life experience to the passage theme
- Place in Introduction, *before* presenting the Core Message

### Step 7 — Create Illustrations & Metaphors
- Develop modern scenarios where principles apply
- Use analogies that clarify (not replace) the text
- Embed these in the "Context & Insights" of each section

---

## Phase 5: Closing Implementation (Moving to Action)

**Goal:** Call for response through decision and practice.

### Step 8 — Craft Decision Questions (Will)
- 1-2 penetrating questions that call for commitment
- Focus on heart posture, not just behavior
- Examples: "Are you ready to...?" "Is your desire to...?"

### Step 9 — Develop Weekly Challenges (Practice)
- Provide 3-4 specific, achievable practices
- Balance internal (journaling, prayer, meditation) and external (action, speech, service)
- Ensure each flows from the passage's main idea
- Emphasize grace-driven effort, not performance

### Step 10 — Write the Closing Prayer
- Reflect the lesson's key confessions, petitions, and praise
- Model Scripture-shaped prayer
- Include: confession, petition for transformation, declaration of truth

### Step 11 — Assemble the Final Document

**Key Guidelines**

1. **Conciseness** — Essential points only; use bullets, tables, and headings.
2. **Clarity** — Active voice; short sentences; defined terms.
3. **Compelling** — Story, questions, application, and calls to action.
4. **Completeness** — Include all required elements without redundancy.
5. **Theological Integrity** — Scripture-based, verse-cited (BSB).
6. **MkDocs Optimization** — Use compatible Markdown features (YAML frontmatter, admonitions, structured headings).

## Critical Distinction: Reflection vs. Application

This lesson model maintains a sharp distinction between two types of questions:

**Reflection Questions (Heart) — During Teaching**
- Placed *within* each section as you teach
- Purpose: Help learners **think deeply** about what the text means for them personally
- Nature: Introspective, diagnostic, exploratory
- Examples: 
  - "What specific *taunts* are you hearing from your *giant*?"
  - "How has God delivered you in the past?"
- These create engagement and internalization without demanding action

**Application Questions (Will) — In the Closing**
- Placed *only* in the Closing section
- Purpose: Call learners to **concrete action** in response to the truth
- Nature: Decisional, behavioral, practical
- Examples:
  - "Are you ready to confront your giant in the name of the LORD?"
  - "Start a Faithfulness Journal this week"
- These demand response and obedience

**Why This Matters:** Reflection builds conviction during teaching; application channels that conviction into obedience at the end. Mixing them diffuses focus.

## Genre Adaptations

The core workflow is adapted based on the biblical genre of the passage.

| Didactic Default              | Narrative                               | Poetry / Wisdom                           | Law                                       | Prophecy / Apocalyptic                         |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Analyze argument structure    | Plot, tension, climax, characters       | Poetic structure & imagery                | Categorise (moral/ceremonial/civil) + underlying principle | Indictment → Judgment → Hope pattern         |
| Key words & logic             | Character arcs & God’s actions          | Emotional arc & metaphors                 | Why this law? → Christ fulfillment        | Historical crisis + symbolic roots           |
| Explicit proposition          | Implicit truth shown in story           | Core emotion or wisdom nugget           | Timeless principle + NT fulfillment       | Big-picture theology (sovereignty, worship, endurance) |
| Obey the command              | Emulate faith / avoid failure           | Pray the psalm / shape imagination        | Live the principle in Christ              | Repent where needed + hope-filled obedience    |

## Workflow Adaptations Based on Genre

There are other common types of passages and our lesson prep approach will adapt for each.

--- 

### 1. Narrative Passages

*   **What they are**. Stories. This is the most common genre in the Bible, covering Genesis, much of the Old Testament historical books (Joshua, Samuel, Kings), the Gospels, and Acts.
*   **Goal of the Genre**. To reveal God's character, His redemptive plan, and the nature of faith through events, characters, and plot. It *shows* truth in action rather than *stating* it as a proposition.
*   **How our Lesson Prep Changes**. Instead of focusing on the "logical argument," we focus on the elements of the story.

| Our Didactic Model Step | How it Changes for the **Narrative Model** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Analyze the Structure** | **Analyze the Plot and Setting**. Ask: Where and when is this happening? What is the central conflict or tension? What is the rising action, the climax, and the resolution? How does this story fit into the larger story of the Bible? |
| **Deep Dive (Linguistics)** | **Character Analysis**. Ask: Who are the main characters? What do their words, actions, and decisions reveal about them? How does God/Jesus function as the central character in the story? What are the characters' flaws and strengths? |
| **Synthesize the Main Idea** | **Discern the Implicit Truth**. The "main point" is rarely stated directly. You must ask: What does this story reveal about God? What does it reveal about humanity? What does it teach about the nature of faith or sin? The truth is *demonstrated*, not declared. |
| **Illustrations & Application** | **Focus on Moral & Theological Example**. Application is less about "obey this command" and more about "emulate this character's faith" or "avoid this character's failure." We ask: How is my story like David's story? How does Jesus' response to the Pharisees in this story challenge how I respond to opposition? |

**Example**. For David and Goliath, our didactic model would struggle. But a narrative model would ask: What does this reveal about God's power to save? What does David's faith look like in action? How is Goliath's arrogance a foil to David's humility? The application is about trusting God against our own "giants."

### 2. Poetry & Wisdom Literature

*   **What they are**. Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes. This genre uses imagery, metaphor, and parallelism to engage the heart and emotions.
*   **Goal of the Genre**. To give voice to the full range of human emotion before God (praise, lament, anger, joy) and to shape the moral imagination for wise living.
*   **How our Lesson Prep Changes**. We shift from analyzing logic to appreciating artistry and emotional resonance.

| Our Didactic Model Step | How it Changes for the **Poetic/Wisdom Model** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Analyze the Structure** | **Analyze the Poetic Structure**. Look for parallelism (lines that repeat, contrast, or build on each other). Identify the central metaphors and images. For a Psalm, trace the emotional arc: does it move from lament to praise? From petition to trust? |
| **Deep Dive (Linguistics)** | **Explore the Imagery**. Instead of just key terms, we ask: Why did the author choose this specific image (a deer panting for water, a rock, a fortress)? What emotions and ideas does this image evoke? |
| **Synthesize the Main Idea** | **Identify the Core Emotion or Wisdom Principle**. For a Psalm, the point is often to feel what the psalmist feels and see God as he sees God. For a Proverb, it's about gleaning a principle for skillful living (not an ironclad promise). |
| **Illustrations & Application** | **Provide a Framework for Prayer and Life**. Application is less about a to-do list and more about formation. "Use this Psalm as a template for your own prayers this week." "How can this proverb shape your perspective on work or finances?" |

### 3. Law

*   **What they are**. The legal codes found primarily in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.
*   **Goal of the Genre**. To set Israel apart as a holy nation and to structure their relationship with a holy God and with each other.
*   **How our Lesson Prep Changes**. This is perhaps the most challenging. The key is to find the principle behind the rule and connect it to Christ.

| Our Didactic Model Step | How it Changes for the **Legal Model** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Analyze the Structure** | **Categorize the Law**. Is this a civil law (governing society), a ceremonial law (related to worship/purity), or a moral law (reflecting God's timeless character)? |
| **Deep Dive (Context)** | **Uncover the "Why."** The most important question is: *Why* was this law given? What does it reveal about God's holiness, justice, or mercy? What specific Canaanite practice was it meant to counteract? Historical context is paramount. |
| **Synthesize the Main Idea** | **Find the Underlying Principle & Bridge to Christ**. This is the crucial step. We ask: 1) What is the timeless principle behind this specific law? 2) How does Jesus Christ fulfill, transform, or embody this principle? (e.g., The sacrificial laws point to Christ's ultimate sacrifice). |
| **Illustrations & Application** | **Apply the Principle, Not the Letter**. The application is almost never to obey the literal command (we don't offer sacrifices). It is to live out the underlying principle in a New Covenant context. (e.g., The principle of the Sabbath becomes a call to find our ultimate rest in Christ). |

### 4. Prophecy & Apocalyptic Literature

*   **What they are**. The messages of the prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos) and visionary writings (Daniel, Revelation).
*   **Goal of the Genre**. To call God's people to repentance and faithfulness by revealing the consequences of sin and the hope of God's future restoration. Apocalyptic literature does this through vivid, symbolic visions to encourage suffering believers.
*   **How our Lesson Prep Changes**. Historical context becomes the absolute king, and we must learn to think in pictures.

| Our Didactic Model Step | How it Changes for the **Prophetic Model** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Analyze the Structure** | **Identify the Prophetic Pattern**. Look for the common pattern: 1) Indictment (What is the sin?), 2) Judgment (What is the coming consequence?), and 3) Hope (What is the promise of future restoration?). |
| **Deep Dive (Context)** | **Anchor in History**. Who was the prophet? Who was he speaking to? What was the specific political and spiritual crisis? Without this, the message is meaningless. For apocalyptic, look for the Old Testament roots of the symbols. |
| **Synthesize the Main Idea** | **Focus on the "Big Picture" Theology**. Don't get lost trying to decode every symbol in Revelation. Ask: What is the main theological message of this vision? (e.g., "God is sovereign over history," "Jesus is worthy of all worship," "Endurance in suffering will be vindicated."). |
| **Illustrations & Application** | **Live in Light of the Truth**. Application is two-fold: 1) How does the prophet's call for repentance against injustice or idolatry speak to our world today? 2) How does the ultimate hope revealed in this passage encourage us to live faithfully and worshipfully right now? |
