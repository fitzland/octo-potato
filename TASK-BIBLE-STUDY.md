# Task: Prepare Adult Bible Study Lesson

This document outlines the standard 5-Phase, 10-Step workflow for preparing adult Bible study lessons, designed to be expository and discussion-driven. This process ensures a consistent approach unless specific genre adaptations are required.

All output generated following this task guide must adhere to the formatting rules defined in [STYLE-MARKDOWN.md](./STYLE-MARKDOWN.md).

## Core Workflow (Didactic Passages – Default)

This sequence is followed unless the genre requires adaptation.

### **Methodology for Developing a Teaching Lesson on a Didactic Passage**

This process is designed to move systematically from deep textual understanding to practical, life-changing application.

**Phase 1: Review the Methodology (Getting Mindset Correct)**
*I want to start each lesson by reviewing our methodology. If there are any changes I will elaborate, so that we can make appropriate modifications to our method.*

**Phase 2: Foundational Exegesis (Understanding the Text)**
*The goal of this phase is to answer the question: "What does this passage actually say and mean?"*

1.  **Isolate and Read the Text**. Begin with a clean reading of the selected passage from your preferred translation (BSB).
2.  **Analyze the Structure**. Break the passage down into its distinct thought-units or rhetorical movements. Identify the flow of the argument: commands, warnings, principles, illustrations, and conclusions. (Our process of synthesizing my initial view with your more rhetorical view was a key part of this).
3.  **Conduct a Deep Dive**.
    *   **Linguistics**. Examine key original language words (like *krinō* and *hypokritēs*) to uncover nuances of meaning that might be lost in translation.
    *   **Cross-References**. Find and analyze relevant parallel passages and thematic connections throughout Scripture. This lets the Bible interpret itself and builds a robust, consistent theological understanding.

**Phase 3: Thematic Synthesis (Defining the Core Message)**
*The goal of this phase is to answer the question: "What is the central, transferable truth of this passage?"*

4.  **Synthesize the Findings**. Distill the detailed analysis from Phase 1 into a clear, concise summary of the passage's main idea. This often involves identifying the core tension or counterintuitive truth Jesus is presenting (e.g., "The efficacy of spiritual correction is determined by the humility of the giver and the receptivity of the receiver"). This becomes the central axis of your lesson.

**Phase 4: Practical Connection (Bridging the Gap to Real Life)**
*The goal of this phase is to answer the question: "Why does this matter to my class today?"*

5.  **Brainstorm Illustrations & Situations**. Develop relatable, modern-day scenarios where the principles of the passage play out (e.g., social media criticism, post-church commentary). Create memorable metaphors and illustrations (the boomerang, the smudged glasses, the surgeon vs. the butcher) to make the abstract concepts concrete.
6.  **Formulate Practical Applications**. Move from general illustrations to specific, actionable advice. Provide practical questions or "self-check" lists that the class can use for personal reflection (e.g., the Log Inventory questions, the checklist for loving correction).

**Phase 5: Actionable Implementation (Living Out the Lesson)**
*The goal of this phase is to answer the question: "What do I do now?"*

7.  **Develop an Icebreaker**. Design a question or two that can be used to introduce the lesson. Our goal with these is to break down any barriers so that we have a relaxed atmosphere for learning; create connection so that people will share about themselves; establish psychological safety so that the participants will know that it is okay to participate; everyone's input is welcome.
8.  **Create Weekly Challenges**. Design three or four specific, achievable challenges that encourage the class to actively practice the lesson's teachings during the week. Offer a variety of challenges that target both internal attitudes and external actions (e.g., the Judgment Fast, the Affirmation Offensive).
9.  **Craft a Closing Prayer**. Write a prayer that summarizes the key confessions, petitions, and praises of the lesson. This models for the class how to turn the teaching into a personal conversation with God and solidifies the main points in their hearts and minds.
10. **Draft Final Document**. Conclude by draft a final document (markdown) which includes all developed content and lesson elements. *Key Guidelines*. 1. Conciseness. Limit sections to essential points. Use bullet points, short paragraphs, and tables where they reduce wordiness. 2. Clarity. Use active voice, short sentences, and headings for navigation. Define any jargon (e.g., "atonement. the act of making amends for sin"). Structure for easy skimming. 3. Compelling. Incorporate storytelling, real-life applications, questions for reflection, and calls to action. Make it motivational, tying biblical truth to personal growth or community impact. 4. Completeness. Include all necessary elements (outlined below) without omissions. If information is relevant, include it succinctly rather than excluding it—err on the side of informativeness while trimming redundancy. 5. Theological Integrity. Base content on Scripture. Avoid personal opinions; cite verses directly (BSB). 6. MkDocs Optimization. Use Markdown features compatible with MkDocs, such as YAML frontmatter for metadata, admonitions (e.g., !!! note), and navigation-friendly headings. Assume MkDocs plugins like search and navigation are enabled.

## Genre Adaptations

The core workflow is adapted based on the biblical genre of the passage.

| Didactic Default              | Narrative                               | Poetry / Wisdom                           | Law                                       | Prophecy / Apocalyptic                         |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Analyze argument structure    | Plot, tension, climax, characters       | Poetic structure & imagery                | Categorise (moral/ceremonial/civil) + underlying principle | Indictment → Judgment → Hope pattern         |
| Key words & logic             | Character arcs & God’s actions          | Emotional arc & metaphors                 | Why this law? → Christ fulfillment        | Historical crisis + symbolic roots           |
| Explicit proposition          | Implicit truth shown in story           | Core emotion or wisdom nugget           | Timeless principle + NT fulfillment       | Big-picture theology (sovereignty, worship, endurance) |
| Obey the command              | Emulate faith / avoid failure           | Pray the psalm / shape imagination        | Live the principle in Christ              | Repent where needed + hope-filled obedience    |

## Workflow Adaptations Based on Genre

There are other common types of passages and our lesson prep approach will adapt for each.

--- 

### 1. Narrative Passages

*   **What they are**. Stories. This is the most common genre in the Bible, covering Genesis, much of the Old Testament historical books (Joshua, Samuel, Kings), the Gospels, and Acts.
*   **Goal of the Genre**. To reveal God's character, His redemptive plan, and the nature of faith through events, characters, and plot. It *shows* truth in action rather than *stating* it as a proposition.
*   **How our Lesson Prep Changes**. Instead of focusing on the "logical argument," we focus on the elements of the story.

| Our Didactic Model Step | How it Changes for the **Narrative Model** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Analyze the Structure** | **Analyze the Plot and Setting**. Ask: Where and when is this happening? What is the central conflict or tension? What is the rising action, the climax, and the resolution? How does this story fit into the larger story of the Bible? |
| **Deep Dive (Linguistics)** | **Character Analysis**. Ask: Who are the main characters? What do their words, actions, and decisions reveal about them? How does God/Jesus function as the central character in the story? What are the characters' flaws and strengths? |
| **Synthesize the Main Idea** | **Discern the Implicit Truth**. The "main point" is rarely stated directly. You must ask: What does this story reveal about God? What does it reveal about humanity? What does it teach about the nature of faith or sin? The truth is *demonstrated*, not declared. |
| **Illustrations & Application** | **Focus on Moral & Theological Example**. Application is less about "obey this command" and more about "emulate this character's faith" or "avoid this character's failure." We ask: How is my story like David's story? How does Jesus' response to the Pharisees in this story challenge how I respond to opposition? |

**Example**. For David and Goliath, our didactic model would struggle. But a narrative model would ask: What does this reveal about God's power to save? What does David's faith look like in action? How is Goliath's arrogance a foil to David's humility? The application is about trusting God against our own "giants."

### 2. Poetry & Wisdom Literature

*   **What they are**. Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes. This genre uses imagery, metaphor, and parallelism to engage the heart and emotions.
*   **Goal of the Genre**. To give voice to the full range of human emotion before God (praise, lament, anger, joy) and to shape the moral imagination for wise living.
*   **How our Lesson Prep Changes**. We shift from analyzing logic to appreciating artistry and emotional resonance.

| Our Didactic Model Step | How it Changes for the **Poetic/Wisdom Model** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Analyze the Structure** | **Analyze the Poetic Structure**. Look for parallelism (lines that repeat, contrast, or build on each other). Identify the central metaphors and images. For a Psalm, trace the emotional arc: does it move from lament to praise? From petition to trust? |
| **Deep Dive (Linguistics)** | **Explore the Imagery**. Instead of just key terms, we ask: Why did the author choose this specific image (a deer panting for water, a rock, a fortress)? What emotions and ideas does this image evoke? |
| **Synthesize the Main Idea** | **Identify the Core Emotion or Wisdom Principle**. For a Psalm, the point is often to feel what the psalmist feels and see God as he sees God. For a Proverb, it's about gleaning a principle for skillful living (not an ironclad promise). |
| **Illustrations & Application** | **Provide a Framework for Prayer and Life**. Application is less about a to-do list and more about formation. "Use this Psalm as a template for your own prayers this week." "How can this proverb shape your perspective on work or finances?" |

### 3. Law

*   **What they are**. The legal codes found primarily in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.
*   **Goal of the Genre**. To set Israel apart as a holy nation and to structure their relationship with a holy God and with each other.
*   **How our Lesson Prep Changes**. This is perhaps the most challenging. The key is to find the principle behind the rule and connect it to Christ.

| Our Didactic Model Step | How it Changes for the **Legal Model** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Analyze the Structure** | **Categorize the Law**. Is this a civil law (governing society), a ceremonial law (related to worship/purity), or a moral law (reflecting God's timeless character)? |
| **Deep Dive (Context)** | **Uncover the "Why."** The most important question is: *Why* was this law given? What does it reveal about God's holiness, justice, or mercy? What specific Canaanite practice was it meant to counteract? Historical context is paramount. |
| **Synthesize the Main Idea** | **Find the Underlying Principle & Bridge to Christ**. This is the crucial step. We ask: 1) What is the timeless principle behind this specific law? 2) How does Jesus Christ fulfill, transform, or embody this principle? (e.g., The sacrificial laws point to Christ's ultimate sacrifice). |
| **Illustrations & Application** | **Apply the Principle, Not the Letter**. The application is almost never to obey the literal command (we don't offer sacrifices). It is to live out the underlying principle in a New Covenant context. (e.g., The principle of the Sabbath becomes a call to find our ultimate rest in Christ). |

### 4. Prophecy & Apocalyptic Literature

*   **What they are**. The messages of the prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos) and visionary writings (Daniel, Revelation).
*   **Goal of the Genre**. To call God's people to repentance and faithfulness by revealing the consequences of sin and the hope of God's future restoration. Apocalyptic literature does this through vivid, symbolic visions to encourage suffering believers.
*   **How our Lesson Prep Changes**. Historical context becomes the absolute king, and we must learn to think in pictures.

| Our Didactic Model Step | How it Changes for the **Prophetic Model** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Analyze the Structure** | **Identify the Prophetic Pattern**. Look for the common pattern: 1) Indictment (What is the sin?), 2) Judgment (What is the coming consequence?), and 3) Hope (What is the promise of future restoration?). |
| **Deep Dive (Context)** | **Anchor in History**. Who was the prophet? Who was he speaking to? What was the specific political and spiritual crisis? Without this, the message is meaningless. For apocalyptic, look for the Old Testament roots of the symbols. |
| **Synthesize the Main Idea** | **Focus on the "Big Picture" Theology**. Don't get lost trying to decode every symbol in Revelation. Ask: What is the main theological message of this vision? (e.g., "God is sovereign over history," "Jesus is worthy of all worship," "Endurance in suffering will be vindicated."). |
| **Illustrations & Application** | **Live in Light of the Truth**. Application is two-fold: 1) How does the prophet's call for repentance against injustice or idolatry speak to our world today? 2) How does the ultimate hope revealed in this passage encourage us to live faithfully and worshipfully right now? |
