# Task: Prepare Adult Bible Study Lesson

This document outlines the standard 5-Phase, 9-Step workflow for preparing adult Bible study lessons, designed to be expository and discussion-driven. This process ensures a consistent approach unless specific genre adaptations are required.

All output generated following this task guide must adhere to the formatting rules defined in [STYLE-MARKDOWN.md](./STYLE-MARKDOWN.md).

## Core Workflow (Didactic Passages – Default)

This sequence is followed unless the genre requires adaptation.

### Phase 1 – Mindset
1.  **Restate Methodology**. Briefly restate the methodology to ensure alignment.

### Phase 2 – Foundational Exegesis
2.  **Isolate & Read Text**. Isolate and read the Bible passage using the Berean Standard Bible (BSB).
3.  **Break into Thought-Units**. Break the text into thought-units or rhetorical movements.
4.  **Deep Dive**. Conduct a deep dive into key Greek/Hebrew words and immediate cross-references.

### Phase 3 – Thematic Synthesis
5.  **Distill Core Message**. Distill the passage into one clear, transferable Core Message (tweetable, counter-intuitive when possible).

### Phase 4 – Practical Connection
6.  **Brainstorm Illustrations**. Brainstorm vivid modern illustrations and metaphors.
7.  **Create Application Questions**. Create specific, searchable application questions or self-checks.

### Phase 5 – Actionable Implementation
8.  **Write Icebreakers & Challenges**. Write 2 icebreaker options and 3–4 concrete weekly challenges.
9.  **Craft Closing Prayer**. Craft a closing prayer that confesses, petitions, and praises the Core Message.

## Genre Adaptations

The core workflow is adapted based on the biblical genre of the passage.

| Didactic Default              | Narrative                               | Poetry / Wisdom                           | Law                                       | Prophecy / Apocalyptic                         |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Analyze argument structure    | Plot, tension, climax, characters       | Poetic structure & imagery                | Categorise (moral/ceremonial/civil) + underlying principle | Indictment → Judgment → Hope pattern         |
| Key words & logic             | Character arcs & God’s actions          | Emotional arc & metaphors                 | Why this law? → Christ fulfillment        | Historical crisis + symbolic roots           |
| Explicit proposition          | Implicit truth shown in story           | Core emotion or wisdom nugget           | Timeless principle + NT fulfillment       | Big-picture theology (sovereignty, worship, endurance) |
| Obey the command              | Emulate faith / avoid failure           | Pray the psalm / shape imagination        | Live the principle in Christ              | Repent where needed + hope-filled obedience    |

## Workflow Adaptations Based on Genre

-   **Narrative**: Focus on plot, tension, climax, characters, and how God acts through them. Emphasize character arcs and God’s actions to reveal implicit truths shown in the story. Application involves emulating faith or avoiding failure.
-   **Poetry / Wisdom**: Analyze poetic structure, imagery, and emotional arcs. Distill the core emotion or wisdom nugget. Application involves praying the psalm or shaping imagination.
-   **Law**: Categorize the law (moral, ceremonial, civil) and identify its underlying principles. Explore *why* this law was given and its fulfillment in Christ. Application focuses on living the principle in Christ.
-   **Prophecy / Apocalyptic**: Identify the indictment → judgment → hope pattern. Understand the historical crisis and symbolic roots. Connect to big-picture theology (sovereignty, worship, endurance). Application involves repentance where needed and hope-filled obedience.
