I'm going to work on Bible study series called: Character Counts.

Christians’ influence on American culture has been declining in recent years. Many people in society view Christians as unloving, hypocritical, and judgmental, and unfortunately, they’ve not always been wrong. When we publicly proclaim allegiance to Christ, it is important that our character match the One we profess to follow. Our character does matter. 

How this study supports the Discipleship Plan: Obey God and Deny Self. 

A key marker of a Christian is obedience to God and His Word. God’s Word calls us to bring our lives into conformity with who Christ is. We are to be like Christ, so we must bring our character, lifestyle, and habits into conformity with His.
