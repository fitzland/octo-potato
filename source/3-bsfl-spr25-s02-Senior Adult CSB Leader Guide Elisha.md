Session 2

God’s Hand in Meeting Our Needs

The Point

God provides for our needs.

Life Connection

A good business practice is to assess what you have and work with what
you’ve got. That wisdom applies to our personal lives as well: We can’t
spend or use what we don’t have. Thankfully, we serve a God who is not
limited in what He can do or provide. When we’re lacking in some area of
our lives, we can call to Him and trust Him to provide what we need when
we need it.

The Passage

2 Kings 4:1-7

The Setting

First and Second Kings focus on Israel’s kings and kingdom. Originally
the two volumes were one, but they were separated by the translators of
the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament.

> The two books as we have them cover a period of approximately 410
> years. During that time Israel was divided into two kingdoms: thus,
> two lines of kings. The citizens of both kingdoms eventually went into
> exile. Although the books deal with kings and their kingdoms, the
> prophets of the Lord God are major participants in the events recorded
> in the books. Most of the ministry of Elijah is recorded in 1 Kings (1
> Kings 17:1—2 Kings 2:18) and that of Elisha in 2 Kings (2:1—13:20).

Getting started

**Discuss: **Draw attention to the question on **PSG, page 119** and ask
**Question 1: When have you received help that arrived just at the right
time?**

**Guide:** Refer the group to **"The Bible Meets Life"** **(PSG, page
119)** to the author’s story about Floyd. Point out to the group Floyd’s
failure to connect his prayers about Seminary with God’s actions
afterward.

**Say:** God loves His people and is never unaware of their needs. He
also knows what is best for us which leads Him to work in ways that help
us, especially in times of need.

**Guide:** Introduce **The Point** on **PSG, page 119: God provides for
our needs.**

**Optional Introduction: **Refer to "Life Connection" on page 122 for an
alternate introduction to the study.

**Pray:** Begin the session with prayer. Ask God to impress upon the
group His care and concern for each one of them. Pray that the session
today will lead each member to turn to God during times of need and to
trust in His response.

Study the Bible

2 Kings 4:1-2

1 One of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha,
“Your servant, my husband, has died. You know that your servant feared
the Lord. Now the creditor is coming to take my two children as his
slaves.” 2 Elisha asked her, “What can I do for you? Tell me, what do
you have in the house?” She said, “Your servant has nothing in the house
except a jar of oil.”

**Summarize:** Before reading the verses, refer to “The Setting” on page
122 to establish the context of the biblical passage.

**Read:** Enlist a volunteer to read 2 Kings 4:1-2.

**say:** Share this connection to The Point: Cry out to God for help in
your time of need.

**Digging Deeper: **See the article **Widows and Poverty, PSG, p. 121.**

**Recap:** Share the author's observations on **PSG, pp. 120–121** to
contrast the widow’s response to her time of need with our reluctance to
ask God for help.

This was not a cry for justice but a cry for mercy.

She cried out to Elisha but she was seeking God’s help.

Her cry for help was genuine.

**say: **Sometimes believers are hesitant to seek God’s help in our time
of need.

  
We hesitate to ask God for help because admitting we need help is
sometimes viewed as an admission of weakness.

We hesitate to ask God for help because we feel we don’t deserve it.

  
We hesitate to ask God for help because our faith is weak.

**say: **Regardless of our reasoning, we shortchange ourselves when we
don’t seek help from the One who loves us and saved us.

**Summarize:** Refer to the **Bible Commentary** to explore the
following terms in order to illuminate the seriousness of the widow’s
need.

****A widow’s situation**** (v. 1).

****The creditor ****(v. 1).

**A jar of oil **(v. 2).

**Discuss:** **Question 2: Why are we sometimes hesitant to cry out to
God for help in our time of need?**

**Alternate Question: **How desperate do you need to be to ask others to
pray for you?

**Transition:** God wants us to seek Him during difficult times but He
also wants us to be ready to respond to His activity with faith.

2 Kings 4:1-2 Commentary

**The sons of the prophets** (v. 1). *Sons* does not indicate a
biological relationship to the prophets, but rather membership in a
class or group. *The sons of the prophets* indicates a community or
guild of prophets. When Elijah was taken into heaven and Elisha
performed miracles, the sons of the prophets bowed before Elisha
recognizing that Elisha’s power was the same power Elijah had possessed
(2:15-18). Later events (4:38-41; 6:1-7) indicate Elisha’s role as
supervisor over the sons of the prophets.

**A widow’s situation** (v. 1). The woman who cried out to Elisha was a
widow of one of the sons of the prophets. In biblical times, widows were
in a very vulnerable position. They often lacked economic, legal, and
physical means of support and could be easily taken advantage of. In
this instance, the widow possessed only a jar of oil, and a creditor was
approaching to take her children as slaves as payment for her debt. The
prophet Elijah dealt with a similar situation involving a widow (1 Kings
17:8-24). The vulnerability of widows led to the early church
designating certain men to oversee both Greek and Jewish widows so the
daily needs of all the widows would be met (Acts 6:1-6; on the early
church’s emphasis on the care of widows and orphans see Jas. 1:27).

**Your servant **(v. 1). The term *servant* can refer to one who serves
God, kings, rulers, as well as anyone who serves a superior. The word
was also commonly used as a term for polite address among equals or in
relation to one who was superior in rank. Most likely the woman was
using the term as an expression of humility toward Elisha. The phrase
would also have been appropriate since her husband had been one of the
sons of the prophets; Elisha as leader of the group would have been her
husband’s superior. That the widow was one of the wives of the sons of
the prophets indicates that the sons of the prophets were permitted to
marry.

**Feared the Lord **(v. 1). By mentioning that her dead husband had
feared the Lord, the widow was communicating to Elisha that he had been
a man who loved and served God with his heart, soul, mind, and strength
(see Deut. 6:4-6; Mark 12:28-30). Lord is a substitution for God’s
covenant name Yahweh, which was viewed as being too holy to speak lest
it be mispronounced. Yahweh emphasizes God’s eternal self-existence and
His self-sufficiency. It is also the title by which God as Creator and
Redeemer called the Israelites into relationship with Him (Ex. 3:13-15).

**The creditor** (v. 1). In the ancient Near East, the practice of
enslaving a person’s wife and/or children as a form of debt payment was
common. The person receiving the loan made a pledge in the form of
property as collateral on the loan, sometimes pledging himself and/or
members of his family against the loan. However, in Deuteronomy 15:1-18
God gave instructions for the care of the poor and vulnerable among His
people; especially those indebted and enslaved. While in Israelite
society everyone was responsible for looking out for the poor and
vulnerable, it was particularly the role of a family member (known as
the kinsman redeemer) to deliver his relatives from indebtedness and
slavery (Lev. 25:47-55). The Hebrew prophets condemned the rich for
their abuse of the poor and helpless of society and called on God’s
people to care for them (Isa. 3:14-15; 58:6-10; Ezek. 22:29; Jer. 5:28;
22:3; Amos 2:6-7; 4:1; Zech. 7:10; Mal. 3:5). That this widow had fallen
into such a desperate situation indicates that God’s instructions and
provisions for the poor had been either forgotten or ignored. However,
through God’s power, Elisha would take on the role of this widow’s
redeemer.

**A jar of oil** (v. 2). The term for *jar* is used only here in the
Hebrew Old Testament. It was most likely a small container. Some suggest
that it was not the standard type of jar used for storing oil in a home,
but rather a small bottle or flask used for anointing. This would have
further emphasized the destitute state of the widow and her two
children.

2 Kings 4:3-4

3 Then he said, “Go out and borrow empty containers from all your
neighbors. Do not get just a few. 4 Then go in and shut the door behind
you and your sons, and pour oil into all these containers. Set the full
ones to one side.”

**Read:** Enlist a volunteer to read 2 Kings 4:3-4.

**say:** Share this connection to The Point: Prepare and plan for God to
provide abundantly.

**Recap:** Share the author's observations on **PSG, p. 123**. Use the
information to highlight how the instructions given were actually a call
to faith and the three basic faith responses to help us see God at work
in our lives, especially when seeking His help.

We respond with an obedient faith.

We respond with an expectant faith.

We respond by giving God whatever resources we have.

**say: **we can see through the widow’s example that God invites us to
position ourselves to receive all that God has for us. Make room for
God’s abundance to be received, regardless of what it might look like.

**Summarize:** Refer to the **Bible Commentary** and discuss the
following terms that support the necessity of trusting God during our
time of need.

****Empty containers ****(v. 3).

****Do not get just a few ****(v. 3).

**Oil **(v. 4).

**Discuss:** **Question 3: How do our actions demonstrate our faith in
God’s provision?**

**Alternate Question: **How does God take our small amount and use it to
make a big difference?

**Transition:** No matter what our circumstances are, God is always
calling us to trust Him. Sometimes our obedience to trust Him leads to
simple solutions for basic needs. But sometimes God responds above and
beyond what we need or deserve.

2 Kings 4:3-4 Commentary

**Borrow** (v. 3). The Hebrew term for *borrow* in this context means to
ask as a favor for temporary use. The term is also used later in the
Elisha account of the axe head used by one of the sons of the prophets
that fell into the water while he was chopping down a tree. The man
cried out, “Oh, my master, it *was* *borrowed*!” (2 Kings 6:5). The term
is also used in the sense of to consult or inquire of either God
(“seek,” Josh. 9:14) or of a person such as a child asking a question of
his or her father (“ask,” 4:21). The word could also be used to inquire
if someone was well (Gen. 43:27; Jer. 15:5), much as the modern-day
question, “How are you doing?”

**Empty containers** (v. 3). Storage containers were typically tall oval
or pear-shaped jars about twenty-five inches in height and
sixteen-inches in diameter, having two or four handles. The bases were
usually rounded, coming to a point. They were placed in stands, in the
holes of wood planks, or pressed into the ground.

> The Hebrew term for *containers* has a wide range of meaning. It was
> the general term for a vessel, object, or utensil. More specifically,
> it could refer to bags, vessels, or containers (1 Sam. 17:49; 1 Kings
> 17:10), weapons and armor (1 Sam. 14:13; 2 Kings 11:11), musical
> instruments (1 Chron. 15:16; 16:42), tools for working (1 King 6:7), a
> yoke for animals such as oxen (2 Sam. 24:22), for
> furniture/furnishings (Ex. 31:7; 39:33), for jewelry (Ex. 3:22), and
> even for boats made out of papyrus reeds. In this instance,
> identifying the borrowed vessels as empty containers emphasizes that
> they were commonplace every-day vessels that God would use to perform
> a miracle. The focus is on God, not the vessels themselves.

> The apostle Paul wrote, “Now we have this treasure in clay jars, so
> that this extraordinary power may be from God and not from us” (2 Cor.
> 4:7). While he did not indicate what this treasure is, most likely it
> refers to the gospel. Clay jars were both ordinary and fragile. As
> believers, we are the conduits God uses to proclaim the message of
> salvation through Jesus Christ. We should be humbled when we are
> compared to ordinary jars; there is nothing about us that deserves to
> be used by God. We should be emboldened to action because God
> accomplishes His purposes through ordinary, people like us.

**Do not get just a few** (v. 3). Elisha was expecting God to do great
things, so he instructed the widow to get more than just a few
containers. The miracle God would perform for the widow was greater than
the small container of oil she possessed (v. 2). The prophet wanted the
widow to see that God could do great things in her life. God’s miracle
was going to be extravagant.

> All our efforts for the kingdom will only be effective inasmuch as we
> are dependent and expectant that God can and will do great things. We
> can and should trust that God “is able to do above and beyond all that
> we ask or think according to the power that works in us” (Eph 3:20).
> This is the very nature of faith itself—which has God as its object.
> We trust what God has already done through Jesus Christ to redeem us,
> and we step out in faith trusting and having an expectant hope for
> what God has promised to do for us and through us in the future.

**Oil** (v. 4) was a major component of life in ancient Israel. The most
common oil was made from olives, due to the abundance of olive trees in
Israel. The oil was extracted from olives using an olive press. Olive
oil was used in food preparation and was an essential part of people’s
diets. It was also used as fuel for lamps (Ex. 25:6; Matt. 25:3), as
medicine in treating wounds (Isa. 1:6; Luke 10:34), as a cosmetic for
perfume and skin care (Ruth 3:3), and in religious ceremonies such as
anointing kings (1 Sam. 10:1), priests (Lev. 8:30), objects such as
altars (Lev. 8:11), markers/pillars (Gen. 35:14), and the tabernacle and
its furnishings (Ex. 40:9-11; Lev. 8:10). Because of the many uses of
oil in daily life, it was also an important commodity of trade. As such,
it was a resource the widow could sell both to pay her families’ debt
and have money on which to live (2 Kings 4:7).

2 Kings 4:5-7

5 So she left. After she had shut the door behind her and her sons, they
kept bringing her containers, and she kept pouring. 6 When they were
full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.” But he replied,
“There aren’t any more.” Then the oil stopped. 7 She went and told the
man of God, and he said, “Go sell the oil and pay your debt; you and
your sons can live on the rest.”

**Read:** Enlist a volunteer to read 2 Kings 4:5-7.

**say:** Share this connection to The Point: Recognize God’s
extraordinary provision.

**Recap: **Refer to **PSG, pp. 125–126** to highlight the author’s
comments about how believers today should understand God’s response to
our cry for help in our time of need and seeing God’s hand in meeting
our needs?

****We serve a God who is not limited in what He can do or provide. ****

****When we’re lacking in some area of our lives, we can call to Him.
****

****  
When we call to Him for help in our time of need, He will in some way
tell us to trust Him.****

****  
God isn’t obligated to always respond to our needs with the technical
definition of a miracle, but we can trust that He will meet our needs.
****

**Discuss: Question 4: When have you seen God meet a big need in a
surprising way?**

**Optional Activity: **See Bonus Content on page 131. Use the activity
“crying baby sounds” and guide the group to conclude that a baby crying
“is a cry for help.” Discuss how a baby’s cry often gets an immediate
response from an adult. Use this example to discuss how God responds
when we cry out for help in our time of need.

**Summarize:** Refer to the **Bible Commentary** to explain the
following words or phrases Use the following terms to demonstrate the
extraordinary level of God’s provision for the widow and her family.

****Parallel to Elijah's miracles****

****Shut the door ****(v. 5).

****Pay ****(v. 7).

**Discuss:** **Question 5: How can we trust that God will provide in our
time of need?**

**Alternate Question: **When have you experienced God’s care through
others?

**Engage:** Invite the group to complete the Engage activity **(PSG, p.

2 Kings 4:5-7 Commentary

**Parallels to Elijah’s miracle.** The prophet Elijah dealt with a
similar situation involving a widow (1 Kings 17:8-24). God had provided
for her, which created an expectation that God was going to perform a
similar miracle in this situation. In both cases, the Lord provided for
a person whom society had cast aside. The Lord used ordinary, everyday
products that were essential to life and their containers to perform the
miracles.

> The miracles of Elijah and Elisha have both similarities and
> differences. Whereas Elijah performed the miracle at Zarephath near
> Sidon (north of Israel in Phoenicia, 1 Kings 17:9), the miracle of
> Elisha apparently took place in Israel. Both widows were in a state of
> desperate need. Elijah’s widow was facing starvation (1 Kings
> 17:10-12), whereas Elisha’s widow was facing both poverty and the loss
> of her children to a creditor (2 Kings 4:1-2). Elijah’s miracle
> focused on a flour jar and an oil jug which remained full until the
> drought the land was experiencing was over (1 Kings 17:14-16), whereas
> Elisha’s miracle used a hands-on approach. The prophet commanded the
> widow and her sons to gather many empty containers and pour oil from
> her jar into the empty containers. Oil flowed out of the single jar
> into the containers until no empty containers remained (2 Kings
> 4:3-6). Both miracles supplied food for the widows and their families.
> The widow in Elijah’s case was provided with flour and oil to make
> food, in Elisha’s miracle he commanded the widow to sell the oil to
> pay off her creditor and provide for her family (1 Kings 17:16; 2
> Kings 4:7).

**Shut the door** (v. 5). This entire event in which God miraculously
provided a massive amount of oil for the widow took place in
secret—behind a closed door. The widow’s neighbors had provided the
containers, but they did not see what happened as her little vessel of
oil continued to fill container after container. That the miracle took
place in secret at the hands of the widow and not in the presence of the
prophet Elisha emphasizes that it was God and His power that were the
source of the miracle as well as demonstrating His care and mercy toward
the widow and her sons.

> Scripture often encourages us to share publicly how God has provided
> for us, and there are times we should declare that the Lord has done
> great things for us. Psalm 126 and other passages like it testify that
> the nations will be drawn to God because of the great things that He
> does for and through His people. However, this session passage
> indicates that there are also times when God’s blessings on our lives
> can and should remain a private matter—just between us and God.
> Regarding both giving to the poor and prayer (6:1-6), Jesus commanded
> that these actions be done in secret and “your Father who sees in
> secret will reward you” (vv. 3-4,6).

**Pay** (v. 7). The Hebrew term has the meaning of to complete or
finish. It can mean to make good (in the sense of paying one’s debts) as
well as to make whole or good (in the sense of restoration). The Hebrew
word contains the same consonants as and is related to the term
*shalom*. Shalom is often translated “peace”; however, it carries a
wider range of meaning than simply the absence of conflict. The Hebrew
concept of shalom is a picture of wholeness and completeness. The widow
was not only able to pay her existing debt; she and her sons were able
to live on the rest. God met the widow’s immediate need and provided for
the daily needs of her family as well.

> God’s provision in the life of this widow foreshadows God’s provision
> through the atoning work of Christ available to all who will repent
> and place their faith in Jesus as Savior and Lord. The initial moment
> of justification (when all the believer’s sins are forgiven, he or she
> is reconciled to God, and permanently receives the perfect
> righteousness of Christ) is followed by the ongoing process of
> sanctification (the life-long process of being transformed into the
> image of Christ in one’s character and behavior).

Live It Out

**Review: Live It Out (PSG, page 127).** Encourage the group to follow
through this week with at least one of the applications.

Hebrews 4:16 tell us, “Therefore, let us approach the throne of grace
with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in
time of need.”

*****  
Assess the true needs in your life.***** Sometimes it may be difficult
to distinguish between wants and needs in our lives. Ask God to reveal
to you what are the true needs in your life.

  
*****Ask for help.***** Lower your pride and raise your faith by asking
God to help you in your time of need. Make it a matter of consistent
prayer.

*****  
Help those in need.***** Look for God’s hand at work revealing to you
how you can be a blessing by meeting the needs of someone who is in a
desperate situation. Ask God to help you to be discerning, sensitive,
and compassionate in response to those in need.

Wrap It Up

**guide:** Emphasize **The Point: God provides for our needs.**

**Guide: **Remind the group that God is not only able to meet our needs,
but He also desires to meet our needs. Encourage them to not hesitate to
cry out to Him, and then look for God’s hand at work, doing what only He
can do.

**Pray:** Lord, we are grateful for Your loving care and concern for us.
Thank You for showing this to us through the story of the widow. Lead us
to call out to You when we experience need and strengthen our faith so
that we respond to Your activity with obedience and preparation.

Engage

Think of a situation in your life where you are in need.  
Ask yourself the following questions:

**What does God want me to do while I wait on His provision? **

**How could I “gather more jars” in anticipation of His provision? **

Bonus Content (Optional)

**Optional Activity:** On your smart phone, search “crying baby sounds”
and be prepared to play it for the group. Ask, “What is this sound?”
Then play it. Continue to ask for responses until someone says, (or you
have to say) “It’s a cry for help.” Discuss how a baby’s cry often gets
an immediate response from an adult. Use this example to discuss how God
responds when we cry out for help in our time of need.
