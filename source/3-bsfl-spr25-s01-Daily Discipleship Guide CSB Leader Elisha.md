Session 1

**God’s Hand in Calling Us  
to Serve**

The Point

God invites us to join Him in His work.

The Passage

1 Kings 19:19-21; 2 Kings 2:7-15

Life Connection

We can be thankful for the way God calls and works through our pastors,
church leaders, and other gifted communicators. The same God who works
through them desires to work through each of us. The same God who called
them also calls each of us. Our response is to see where He is at work
and join Him in the task He calls us to.

Background

**1 Kings 19. **The events in 1 Kings 18 were the climax of Elijah’s
ministry. He had challenged King Ahab to summon all the Israelites along
with all the prophets of the false gods Baal and Asherah to gather at
Mount Carmel (18:19). There the Lord through Elijah defeated all the
false prophets (vv. 20-40). Afterward, Ahab’s wife, Jezebel, sent a
messenger to Elijah who informed the prophet the queen was planning to
have him killed. Fearing for his life, Elijah fled into the wilderness,
and God brought him to Mount Horeb (19:1-9). At Mount Horeb, God spoke
to Elijah, commanding the prophet to anoint Hazael as king of Aram, Jehu
as king of Israel, and Elisha as prophet in Elijah’s place (vv. 9-18).

**2 Kings 2.** The time of Elijah’s departure arrived. When the Lord
told Elijah to go first to Bethel and then Jericho, both times Elijah
told Elisha to “stay here,” and both times Elisha refused. In both
Bethel and Jericho, “the sons of the prophets” told Elisha that the Lord
was taking Elijah away (2:1-5). Elijah told Elisha that the Lord had
commanded him to go to the Jordan River, and again Elisha told Elijah
that he would not leave the prophet. So the two traveled to the Jordan
River (v. 6).

Getting started

Discuss: Give your group an opportunity to discuss **Question \#1 **on
page 95 of the Daily Discipleship Guide (DDG): **What are some skills or
talents in which you excel?**

Recap (DDG, page 96): Invite a volunteer to read **The Bible Meets
Life** to introduce the session:

Michael Jordan is one of the greatest basketball players of all time.
Jordan won six championships and was named NBA Finals Most Valuable
Player (MVP) every time. He was the NBA MVP five times and a
fourteen-time NBA All-Star. If you placed a basketball in the hands of
Michael Jordan in his prime, great things happened. Even more so, God is
able to do great things through us when we respond to His call to join
Him and serve, just as in the life of Elisha.

STUDY the BIBLE

**1 Kings 19:19-21**

**19 Elijah left there and found Elisha son of Shaphat as he was
plowing. Twelve teams of oxen were in front of him, and he was with the
twelfth team. Elijah walked by him and threw his mantle over him. 20
Elisha left the oxen, ran to follow Elijah, and said, “Please let me
kiss my father and mother, and then I will follow you.” “Go on back,” he
replied, “for what have I done to you?” 21 So he turned back from
following him, took the team of oxen, and slaughtered them. With the
oxen’s wooden yoke and plow, he cooked the meat and gave it to the
people, and they ate. Then he left, followed Elijah, and served him.**

**1 Kings 19:19-21 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **At God’s direction, Elijah anointed Elisha
to serve, and Elisha left his livelihood to obediently follow Elijah.

**Elijah** **(v. 19).** A ninth-century prophet from Tishbe in the
Northern Kingdom of Israel (1 Kings 17:1–2 Kings 2:12). Much of his
ministry entailed his confrontations with King Ahab of Israel and Ahab’s
wife, Jezebel, because they promoted polytheism rather the worshiping
Yahweh, the one true God. Early in his ministry, Elijah declared to King
Ahab that there would be no rain in the land apart from the prophet’s
command (1 Kings 17:1). During the drought, Elijah went to Zarephath (a
town south of Sidon on the Mediterranean seacoast), where he first
miraculously provided for a widow and her son, and then, after the son’s
death, raised him from the dead (vv. 8-24). Elijah is perhaps best known
for God’s victory over the prophets of Baal and Asherah at Mount Carmel
(chapter 18).

**Elisha** **(v. 19).** Elisha’s name is a combination of the Hebrew
words for God and salvation, so his name means “My God is salvation” or
“My God saves.” Elisha is called “man of God” about thirty times in the
narratives about him in 1 and 2 Kings; this title is used for Moses as
well (Deuteronomy 33:1; Joshua 14:6).

**Mantle** **(v. 19).** The Hebrew term for *mantle* appears twelve
times in the Old Testament. It is associated with both a physical outer
garment (cloak or robe) and the idea of splendor and glory. The English
phrase “pass the mantle” is used today even in secular contexts for one
leader passing on leadership to his or her successor and may have
originated with this story. By placing his mantel on Elisha, Elijah
obeyed God’s command to anoint Elisha as prophet in his place (v. 16).
The act also symbolized the passing of Elijah’s prophetic power and
authority to Elisha.

**“Kiss my father and mother”** **(v. 20).** The implication is that
Elisha was not a reluctant prophet, but a realistic one. He understood
the cost of discipleship, and he was returning to say goodbye to his
parents, his life, and his security. There is an echo of the call of
Abram in this text (Genesis 12:1-3), as God called both men to leave the
security of family and home and depend on the providence and power of
God.

**“For what have I done to you?”** **(v. 20).** By asking this
rhetorical question, Elijah was communicating to Elisha that the call on
Elisha’s life was not actually from Elijah. Though Elijah was acting as
God’s mouthpiece, the call on Elisha’s life was from God Himself.
Consequently, though Elisha would serve as Elijah’s attendant, Elisha’s
service was ultimately to God and not his mentor.

**The oxen’s wooden yoke and plow** **(v. 21).** The use of the yoke and
plow to cook the meat was an act that symbolized the clear break Elisha
was making with his former life, to which he would not be returning.
Jesus used similar imagery when He described the separation from one’s
former life in relation to being His disciple (Luke 9:62).

**Gave it to the people (v. 21).** Elisha’s return to his home to bid
farewell to his father and mother was not merely a return to his nuclear
family. In the ancient world, households included extended families as
well as those in the service of the family. In addition to any sons and
daughters, Elisha’s parents’ household would have been made up of
relatives, household servants, and even close friends. By returning to
his parents’ household and sacrificing the oxen, Elisha was able to
serve an entire group of people, and they were blessed by his sacrifice.
By making this kind of sacrifice, Elisha was also communicating the joy
he had in being called to be the Lord’s prophet.

**Followed . . . served** **(v. 21).** The Hebrew term for “followed”
means to walk in both a literal sense and figuratively in reference to
one’s lifestyle or pattern of conduct. The term for “served” means to
minister or attend. Elisha’s call from God was to the lifestyle of
service to Yahweh first as Elijah’s attendant, and later as Elijah’s
successor as a prophet of God.

**2 Kings 2:7-11**

**7 Fifty men from the sons of the prophets came and stood observing
them at a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan. 8 Elijah
took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water, which parted to the
right and left. Then the two of them crossed over on dry ground. 9 When
they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I can do for
you before I am taken from you.” So Elisha answered, “Please, let me
inherit two shares of your spirit.” 10 Elijah replied, “You have asked
for something difficult. If you see me being taken from you, you will
have it. If not, you won’t.” 11 As they continued walking and talking, a
chariot of fire with horses of fire suddenly appeared and separated the
two of them. Then Elijah went up into heaven in the whirlwind.**

**2 Kings 2:7-11 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **Knowing Elijah would soon depart, Elisha
asked for the Spirit of God to be with him as He was with Elijah.

**The sons of the prophets (v. 7).** This phrase appears only between 1
Kings 20 and 2 Kings 9 in the Old Testament. The word “sons” does not
indicate a biological relationship, but rather some type of prophetic
group or guild. The “sons of the prophets” were under the authority of a
greater prophet of God (2 Kings 6:1).

**Struck the water** **(v. 8).** Elijah’s actions here echo Moses’s
actions when God parted the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21-31). In both cases,
the individual was the means God used to display His power. The staff
that Moses used and the mantle Elijah used were not magical items with
the power to create miracles. Instead, they were symbols of the power of
God to do miraculous activity and demonstrated that as the Creator, He
has power over nature.

**“Let me inherit” (v. 9).** This phrase speaks to the familial
relationship Elijah and Elisha shared. It also indicates that Elisha
understood that the prophetic role he would take up in Elijah’s place
was received according to God’s grace and power.

**“Two shares of your spirit”** **(v. 9).** God instructed the people of
Israel that their firstborn sons were to inherit a double portion of
their fathers’ estates (Deuteronomy 21:17). This phrase indicates the
familial nature of the relationship between Elijah and Elisha. “Your
spirit” refers to the Spirit of God which rested on Elijah. Elisha’s
reference to “your spirit” demonstrates he understood he would be
inheriting Elijah’s responsibilities as a prophet, and that such
prophetic responsibilities were a gift from God and exercised through
God’s power.

**Chariot of fire with horses of fire** **(v. 11).** In this context,
fire symbolizes the presence of God. In  
the ancient world, the power of a king and his kingdom was often
measured by the strength of the army—horses, chariots, and charioteers
(Exodus 14:7-9; Joshua 17:16-18; 1 Samuel 13:5; 1 Kings 10:26). In a
similar way, the omnipotent power of God is demonstrated by His army of
fiery horses and chariots.

Just as the fire God sent down on Mount Carmel demonstrated His
omnipotent power over the false gods Baal and Asherah (1 Kings
18:19-40), so now in taking Elijah to heaven the Lord demonstrated His
power over life and death. Elijah did not die but was taken alive into
God’s presence.

**Heaven (v. 11).** In the Old Testament, the Lord’s presence is said to
dwell in different places. The garden of Eden, the tabernacle, and the
temple were sacred spaces where God dwelt among His people. However,
throughout the Old Testament God is also said to dwell in heaven. In
fact, Deuteronomy 26:15 declares that heaven is God’s “holy dwelling.”
From  
heaven God rules all creation and relates to humanity, sending blessings
and passing judgments over the people who dwell on the earth. So, when
Elijah was taken up **into heaven in the whirlwind,** all those who were
watching would have understood that Elijah had entered into the place
where God’s presence dwells.

**The whirlwind** **(v. 11).** The false Canaanite god Baal was believed
to have power over fertility, the seasons, rain, and wind. By taking
Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, the Lord was demonstrating, as He
had done both through the drought (1 Kings 17:1; 18:1) and at Mount
Carmel (18:19-40), that He alone is Lord over creation and is the one
true God.

**2 Kings 2:12-15**

**12 As Elisha watched, he kept crying out, “My father, my father, the
chariots and horsemen of Israel!” When he could see him no longer, he
took hold of his own clothes, tore them in two, 13 picked up the mantle
that had fallen off Elijah, and went back and stood on the bank of the
Jordan. 14 He took the mantle Elijah had dropped, and he struck the
water. “Where is the Lord God of Elijah?” he asked. He struck the water
himself, and it parted to the right and the left, and Elisha crossed
over. 15 When the sons of the prophets from Jericho who were observing
saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to
meet him and bowed down to the ground in front of him.**

**2 Kings 2:12-15 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **It was evident that the Spirit of God
rested on Elisha as he returned from the place of Elijah’s departure.

**“My father”** **(v. 12).** The relationship that was implicit in
Elisha’s request to inherit two shares of Elijah’s spirit (v. 9) is now
made clear. Elisha had a familial relationship with Elijah, viewing him
as a spiritual father. A similar relationship existed between
Elijah/Elisha and the sons of the prophets (vv. 3,5). This perspective
echoes the relationship Jesus has with believers (Mark 3:34-35).

**“The chariots and horsemen of Israel”** **(v. 12).** The “chariots and
horsemen” represent God’s presence and strength. That Elisha identified
them with Israel indicates both that God is Israel’s true strength and
that the power behind Elijah’s ministry was God. Now God was taking
Elijah up into heaven.

**Tore them** **(v. 12).** Throughout Scripture, the tearing of one’s
clothes signified mourning and grief. For instance, when Elijah
proclaimed God’s judgment on King Ahab of Israel for all his evil and
idolatry, Ahab tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and fasted in grief
and repentance (1 Kings 21:17-27). When Job was informed his wealth had
been taken from him and his children had been killed, he tore his robe
and shaved his head (Job 1:13-20). The tearing of one’s clothes was also
a reaction to situations that were considered to be blasphemous. At
Jesus’s hearing before the Sanhedrin, the Jewish high priest tore his
robes when he (falsely) believed Jesus’s claim to be the Messiah was
blasphemy (Matthew 26:63-65). Paul and Barnabas tore their clothes when
the people of Lystra tried to worship them (Acts 14:11-15).

**Picked up the mantle** **(v. 13).** By picking up Elijah’s “mantle*,”*
Elisha picked up not only Elijah’s physical clothes but also took on
Elijah’s spiritual role as God’s prophet.

**“Where is the Lord God of Elijah?”** **(v. 14).** Elisha did not ask
this question from a position of doubt but from one of boldness and
belief. He knew he was the successor to Elijah. Elisha was entreating
God to display His power through him in the same way He had displayed
that power through Elijah.

**“The spirit of Elijah”** **(v. 15).** The sons of the prophets
recognized that the Spirit who had rested on Elijah now rested on
Elisha. While that power would be made manifest in miraculous acts—such
as the parting of water and later in raising the dead—the most
miraculous act Elisha would perform was to speak the words of God. From
the beginning of time until now, the thing people need is not miraculous
healings or great displays of power, but the Word of God spoken to them
in such a way that they can hear, understand, and respond in faith to
the Creator God who loves them and desires to have a relationship with
them (John 1:10-13; 3:16-18; Hebrews 3:15).

**Bowed down** **(v. 15).** In Elisha’s day and in some cultures today,
bowing down indicates submission to authority. By bowing before Elisha,
the sons of the prophets submitted themselves to Elisha’s authority and
affirmed what God had already done—made Elisha His prophet in place of
Elijah. Similarly, when the church at Antioch commissioned Barnabas and
Saul as missionaries, they were recognizing that the Holy Spirit had set
apart and empowered the two for the task (Acts 13:1-3).

Interestingly, in spite of their actions of bowing down before Elisha,
there apparently was some lingering doubt among the sons of the prophets
as to whether Elisha was God’s prophet in Elijah’s place. Believing the
Lord might have moved Elijah to another earthly location, they
persistently asked Elisha if some of them could go in search of Elijah.
Elisha finally relented and after their search, they returned to report
they had not found Elijah (2 Kings 2:16-18).

Live it out

Ask: What actions will you take in response to today’s study?

Guide: Direct your group to review the three bulleted statements under
**Live It Out **on page 98 of the DDG. Call on volunteers to share (1)
which of these statements is something they want to pursue further, or
(2) ways this study will transform how they focus on joining God in His
work this week.

- **Learn by example. **Commit to a daily study of God’s Word. Look for
  > biblical examples of men and women who sacrificed their comfort to
  > fulfill God’s call on their lives.

- **Let go.** What are you unwilling to sacrifice to follow God’s call
  > on your life? Ask the Lord to help you let go of whatever is holding
  > you back from living out His unique call on your life.

- **Know your call. **Write down where you believe God is inviting you
  > to join Him in His work. Talk to a mentor or your small group leader
  > about opportunities to become involved in God’s work in your church
  > or community.

Wrap It Up

GUIDE: Invite each person to gather with two or three Christ-followers
of the same gender this week for a deeper discussion, using **Talk It
Out** (page 98 of the DDG) to guide their discussion. Encourage your
group to spend time each day in God’s Word with the **Daily Study**
section (pages 99-104 of the DDG).

NOTE: Encourage the group to check out the results of the survey they
took earlier by scanning the QR code on page 97 of their DDG (or by
clicking on the link, if they are using an eBook).

RECAP: Read or restate from page 98 of the DDG.
