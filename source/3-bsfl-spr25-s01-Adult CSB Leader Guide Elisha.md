God’s Hand in Calling Us  
to Serve

The Point

God invites us to join Him in His work.

The Passage

1 Kings 19:19-21; 2 Kings 2:7-15

The Bible Meets Life

I receive invitations on a regular basis. Not the big invitations such
as, “The President and First Lady invite you to spend Christmas at the
White House.” The invitations I receive are more mundane. This past week
I received several invitations in the mail. The local car dealer invited
me to look at their new inventory and maybe even spend thousands of
dollars on a vehicle. I’ll pass. A satellite TV provider invited me to
enter into a two-year contract at a price that will not go up during the
two years. No thanks. I also received an invitation from the county to
pay my property taxes in a timely fashion and avoid jail time. I might
take them up on that one.

While it would be unwise to accept every invitation we receive, we
should accept some without hesitation. One is God’s invitation to join
Him in His work, and the primary way He delivers the invitation is to
reveal what He’s doing. Elisha sets the example for how we should
respond to God’s call to join Him and serve.

**1 Kings 19:19-21**

**19 Elijah left there and found Elisha son of Shaphat as he was
plowing. Twelve teams of oxen were in front of him, and he was with the
twelfth team. Elijah walked by him and threw his mantle over him. 20
Elisha left the oxen, ran to follow Elijah, and said, “Please let me
kiss my father and mother, and then I will follow you.” “Go on back,” he
replied, “for what have I done to you?” 21 So he turned back from
following him, took the team of oxen, and slaughtered them. With the
oxen’s wooden yoke and plow, he cooked the meat and gave it to the
people, and they ate. Then he left, followed Elijah, and served him.**

**1 Kings 19:19-21 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **At God’s direction, Elijah anointed Elisha
to serve, and Elisha left his livelihood to obediently follow Elijah.

**Context. **The events in 1 Kings 18 were the climax of the prophet
Elijah’s ministry. Elijah had challenged King Ahab to summon all the
Israelites, along with all the prophets of the false gods Baal and
Asherah to gather at Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18:19). There the Lord
through Elijah defeated all the false prophets (vv. 20-40). Afterward,
Ahab’s wife, Jezebel, sent a messenger to Elijah who informed the
prophet the queen was planning to have him killed. Fearing for his life,
Elijah fled into the wilderness, and God brought him to Mount Horeb
(19:1-9). At Mount Horeb, God spoke to Elijah, commanding the prophet to
anoint Hazael (*HAZ ay el*) as king of Aram, Jehu as king over Israel,
and Elisha as prophet in Elijah’s place (vv. 9-18).

**Elijah** **(v. 19)** was a ninth-century prophet from Tishbe in the
Northern Kingdom of Israel (1 Kings 17:1–2 Kings 2:12). Much of his
ministry entailed his confrontations with King Ahab of Israel and Ahab’s
wife, Jezebel, because they promoted polytheism rather the worshiping
Yahweh, the one, true God. Early in his ministry, Elijah declared to
King Ahab that there would be no rain in the land apart from the
prophet’s command (1 Kings 17:1). During the drought, Elijah went to
Zarephath (*ZAR ih fath*; a town south of Sidon on the Mediterranean
seacoast), where he first miraculously provided for a widow and her son,
and then after the son’s death raised him from the dead (vv. 8-24).
Elijah is perhaps best known for God’s victory over the prophets of Baal
and Asherah at Mount Carmel (chap. 18).

**Elisha** **(v. 19).** Elisha’s name is a combination of the Hebrew
words for God and salvation, so his name means “My God is salvation” or
“My God saves.” Elisha is called “man of God” about thirty times in the
narratives about him in 1 and 2 Kings, and that title is used for Moses
as well (Deut. 33:1; Josh. 14:6).

**Mantle** **(v. 19).** The Hebrew term for *mantle* appears twelve
times in the Old Testament. It is associated with both a physical outer
garment (cloak or robe) and the idea of splendor and glory. The English
phrase “pass the mantle” is used today even in secular contexts for one
leader passing on leadership to his or her successor and may have
originated with this story. By placing his mantel on Elisha, Elijah was
obeying God’s command to anoint Elisha as prophet in his place (v. 16).
The act also symbolized the passing of Elijah’s prophetic power and
authority to Elisha.

**“Kiss my father and mother”** **(v. 20).** The implication of this
phrase is that Elisha was not a reluctant prophet, but he was a
realistic one. He understood the cost of discipleship, and he was
returning to say goodbye to his parents, his life, and his security.
There is an echo of the call of Abram in this text (Gen. 12:1-3), as God
called both men to leave the security of family and home and depend on
the providence and power of God.

**“For what have I done to you?”** **(v. 20).** By asking this
rhetorical question, Elijah was communicating to Elisha that the call on
Elisha’s life was not actually from Elijah. Though Elijah was acting as
God’s mouthpiece, the call on Elisha’s life was from God Himself.
Consequently, though Elisha would serve as Elijah’s attendant, Elisha’s
service was ultimately to God and not his mentor.

**The oxen’s wooden yoke and plow** **(v. 21).** The use of the *yoke*
and *plow* to cook the meat was an act that symbolized the clear break
Elisha was making with his former life, to which he would not be
returning. Jesus used similar imagery when He described the type of
separation from one’s former life in relation to being His disciple, “No
one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom
of God” (Luke 9:62).

**Gave it to the people (v. 21).** Elisha’s return to his home to bid
farewell to his parents was not merely a return to his nuclear family.
In the ancient world households included extended families, as well as
those in the service of the family. In addition to any children,
Elisha’s parents’ household would have been made up of relatives,
household servants, and even close friends. By returning to his parents’
household and sacrificing the oxen, Elisha was able to serve an entire
group of people, and they were blessed by his sacrifice. By making this
kind of sacrifice, Elisha was also communicating the joy that he had in
being called to be the Lord’s prophet.

**2 Kings 2:7-11**

**7 Fifty men from the sons of the prophets came and stood observing
them at a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan. 8 Elijah
took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water, which parted to the
right and left. Then the two of them crossed over on dry ground. 9 When
they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I can do for
you before I am taken from you.” So Elisha answered, “Please, let me
inherit two shares of your spirit.” 10 Elijah replied, “You have asked
for something difficult. If you see me being taken from you, you will
have it. If not, you won’t.” 11 As they continued walking and talking, a
chariot of fire with horses of fire suddenly appeared and separated the
two of them. Then Elijah went up into heaven in the whirlwind.**

**2 Kings 2:7-11 **Commentary

**Connection to the Point.** Knowing Elijah would soon depart, Elisha
asked for the Spirit of God to be with him as He was with Elijah.

**Context.** The time of Elijah’s departure arrived. When the Lord told
Elijah to go to first Bethel and then Jericho, both times Elijah told
Elisha to “stay here,” and both times Elisha refused to leave the
prophet. In both Bethel and Jericho, “the sons of the prophets” told
Elisha that the Lord was taking Elijah away (2 Kings 2:1-5). Elijah told
Elisha that the Lord had commanded him to go to the Jordan River, and
again Elisha told Elijah that he would not leave the prophet. So the two
traveled to the Jordan (v. 6).

**The sons of the prophets (v. 7).** This phrase appears only between 1
Kings 20 and 2 Kings 9 in the Old Testament. The word *sons* does not
indicate a biological relationship, but rather some type of prophetic
group or guild. *The sons of the prophets* were under the authority of a
greater prophet of God (2 Kings 6:1).

**Struck the water** **(v. 8).** Elijah’s actions here echo Moses’s
actions when God parted the Red Sea (Ex. 14:21-31). In both cases, the
individual was the means God used to display His power. The staff that
Moses used and the mantle that Elijah used were not magical items with
the power to create miracles. Instead, they were symbols of the power of
God to do miraculous activity and demonstrated that as the Creator He
has power over nature.

**“Let me inherit “(v. 9).** This phrase speaks to the familial
relationship Elijah and Elisha shared. It also indicates that Elisha
understood that the prophetic role he would take up in Elijah’s place
was received according to God’s grace and power.

**“Two shares of your spirit”** **(v. 9).** God instructed the people of
Israel that their firstborn sons were to inherit a double portion of
their fathers’ estates (Deut. 21:17). This phrase indicates the familial
nature of the relationship between Elijah and Elisha. *Your spirit*
refers to the Spirit of God which rested on Elijah. Elisha’s reference
to *your spirit* demonstrates he understood he would be inheriting
Elijah’s responsibilities as a prophet and that such responsibilities
were a gift from God.

**Chariot of fire with horses of fire** **(v. 11).** In this context,
*fire* symbolizes the presence of God. In the ancient world, the power
of a king and his kingdom was often measured by the strength of the
army—horses, chariots, and charioteers (Ex. 14:7-9; Josh. 17:16-18; 1
Sam. 13:5; 1 Kings 10:26). In a similar way, the omnipotent power of God
is demonstrated by His army of fiery horses and chariots.

Just as the fire God sent down upon Mount Carmel demonstrated His
omnipotent power over the false gods Baal and Asherah (1 Kings
18:19-40), so now in taking Elijah to heaven the Lord demonstrated His
power over life and death. Elijah did not die but was taken alive into
God’s presence.

**Heaven (v. 11).** In the Old Testament, the Lord’s presence is said to
dwell in different places. The garden of Eden, the tabernacle, and the
temple were sacred spaces where God dwelt among His people. However,
throughout the Old Testament God is also said to dwell in heaven. In
fact, Deuteronomy 26:15 declares that heaven is God’s “holy dwelling.”
From heaven God rules all creation and relates to humanity, sending
blessings and passing judgments over the people who dwell on the earth.
So, when Elijah was taken up “into heaven in the whirlwind,” all those
who were watching would have understood that Elijah had entered into the
place where God’s presence dwells.

**The whirlwind** **(v. 11).** The false Canaanite god Baal was
worshiped as the Rider of the Clouds and was believed to have power over
fertility, the seasons, rain, and wind. By taking Elijah up to heaven in
a whirlwind, the Lord was demonstrating, as He had done both through the
drought (1 Kings 17:1; 18:1) and at Mount Carmel (18:19-40), that He
alone is Lord over creation and is the one true God.

**2 Kings 2:12-15**

**12 As Elisha watched, he kept crying out, “My father, my father, the
chariots and horsemen of Israel!” When he could see him no longer, he
took hold of his own clothes, tore them in two, 13 picked up the mantle
that had fallen off Elijah, and went back and stood on the bank of the
Jordan. 14 He took the mantle Elijah had dropped, and he struck the
water. “Where is the Lord God of Elijah?” he asked. He struck the water
himself, and it parted to the right and the left, and Elisha crossed
over. 15 When the sons of the prophets from Jericho who were observing
saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to
meet him and bowed down to the ground in front of him.**

**2 Kings 2:12-15 **Commentary

**Connection to the Point.** It was evident that the Spirit of God
rested on Elisha as he returned from the place of Elijah’s departure.

**“My father”** **(v. 12).** The relationship which was implicit in
Elisha’s request to inherit two shares of Elijah’s spirit (v. 9) is now
made clear. Elisha had a familial relationship with Elijah, viewing him
as a spiritual father. A similar relationship existed between
Elijah/Elisha and the sons of the prophets (vv. 3,5). This perspective
echoes the relationship Jesus has with believers, “Here are my mother
and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister
and mother” (Mark 3:34-35).

**“The chariots and horsemen of Israel”** **(v. 12).** The *chariots*
and *horsemen* of fire represent God’s presence and strength. That
Elisha identified them with Israel indicates both that God is Israel’s
true strength and that the power behind Elijah’s ministry was God. Now
God was taking Elijah up into heaven.

This is another indication that God is greater than the false Canaanite
god Baal. The Lord has power over both storms (Baal was said to be the
storm god) and over life and death. The God of Israel is not merely some
regional god whose power is limited to a geographic area or a certain
group of people. He is Lord over all creation and all peoples. He alone
deserves our worship. He calls all people to repent and place their
faith in Jesus Christ; when they do this, they will find abundant and
eternal life.

**Tore them** **(v. 12).** Throughout Scripture, the tearing of one’s
clothes signifies mourning and grief. For instance, when Elijah
proclaimed God’s judgment upon King Ahab of Israel for all his evil and
idolatry, Ahab tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and fasted in grief
and repentance (1 Kings 21:17-27). When Job was informed his wealth had
been taken from him and his children had been killed, he tore his robe
and shaved his head (Job 1:13-20). The tearing of one’s clothes was also
a reaction to situations which were considered to be blasphemous. At
Jesus’s hearing before the Sanhedrin, the Jewish high priest tore his
robes when he (falsely) believed Jesus’s claim to be the Messiah was
blasphemy (Matt. 26:63-65). Paul and Barnabas tore their clothes when
the people of Lystra tried to worship them (Acts 14:11-15).

**Picked up the mantle** **(v. 13).** By picking up Elijah’s *mantle,*
Elisha picked up not only Elijah’s physical clothes but also took on
Elijah’s spiritual role as God’s prophet.

**“Where is the Lord God of Elijah?”** **(v. 14).** Elisha did not ask
this question from a position of doubt but from a position of boldness
and belief. He knew that he was the successor to Elijah. Elisha was
entreating God to display His power through him in the same way that He
had displayed that power through Elijah.

**“The spirit of Elijah”** **(v. 15).** The sons of the prophets
recognized that the Spirit who had rested on Elijah now rested on
Elisha. As such, the power of God that Elijah had access to was now
available to Elisha. While that power would be made manifest in
miraculous acts such as the parting of water and later in raising the
dead, the most miraculous act that Elisha would perform was to speak the
words of God. From the beginning of time until now, the one thing that
people need more than anything else is not miraculous healings or great
displays of power. It is the Word of God being spoken to them in such a
way that they can hear, understand, and respond in faith to the Creator
God who loves them and desires to have a relationship with them (John
1:10-13; 3:16-18; Heb. 3:15).

**Bowed down** **(v. 15).** Both in the world of Elisha’s day and in
some cultures today, the action of bowing down indicates submission to
authority. By bowing down before Elisha, the sons of the prophets
submitted themselves to Elisha’s authority and affirmed what God had
already done—made Elisha His prophet in place of Elijah. In a similar
manner, when the church at Antioch commissioned Barnabas and Saul as
missionaries, they were recognizing that the Holy Spirit had set apart
and empowered the two for the task (Acts 13:1-3).

Interestingly, in spite of their actions of bowing down before Elisha
there apparently was some lingering doubt among the sons of the prophets
as to whether Elisha was God’s prophet in Elijah’s place. Believing the
Lord might have moved Elijah to another earthly location, they
persistently asked Elisha that some of them might go in search of
Elijah. Elisha finally relented and after their search they returned to
report they had not found Elijah (2 Kings 2:16-18).
