God’s Hand in Restoring Lives

The Point

God restores us as we are obedient to Him.

The Passage

2 Kings 5:1-3,10-12,14-17

The Bible Meets Life

Contestant number 43,212 walked onto the stage to audition for
*Britain’s Got Talent*. She stood in sharp contrast to previous
performers. Unkempt curly hair and a less than flattering dress
suggested a frumpy housewife. Simon Cowell interviewed her briefly and
her admission that she was 47 years old caused raised eyebrows and
scattered laughter from the audience. Her awkward verbal responses added
to the anticipation that her performance would be cut short quickly.
Expectations hit rock bottom when she revealed the ambitious choice to
sing “I Dreamed a Dream” from *Les Misérables. *

But when contestant number 43,212 finished singing just the first
phrase, “I dreamed a dream in time gone by,” the audience cheered and
applauded, while each judge wore a look of amazement and disbelief. Her
voice was beautiful and strong. She finished the song to a standing
ovation, and Susan Boyle was on her way. Simon Cowell said later she was
the textbook example of “never judge a book by its cover.”

Sometimes God surprises us in the same way, working in ways and through
people we might not expect.

**2 Kings 5:1-3**

**1 Naaman, commander of the army for the king of Aram, was a man
important to his master and highly regarded because through him, the
Lord had given victory to Aram. The man was a valiant warrior, but he
had a skin disease. 2 Aram had gone on raids and brought back from the
land of Israel a young girl who served Naaman’s wife. 3 She said to her
mistress, “If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria, he
would cure him of his skin disease.”**

**2 Kings 5:1-3 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **God used a Jewish servant girl to point
Naaman’s wife to the prophet of God.

**Aram** **(v. 1).** Aram was a loose confederation of cities and towns
sometimes referred to as Syria; it is also referred to by its most
prominent city, Damascus. The Old Testament mentions people from Aram on
several occasions. Deuteronomy 26:5 indicates Jacob and by extension
Abraham were Arameans. The father of Rebekah, Isaac’s wife, was “Bethuel
the Aramean of Paddan-aram” (Gen. 25:20). While there was never an
Aramean empire like those of the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Assyrians,
Arameans played a role in Old Testament history (for examples: 2 Sam.
8:5-6; 10:8-19; 1 Kings 11:25; 20:1-29).

The shift in focus from the prophet Elisha (2 Kings 4) to the Aramean
Naaman (chap. 5) emphasizes that God’s focus was not limited to the
descendants of Abraham; God’s intention was always to bless all the
nations of the earth through Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3). That *the Lord had
given victory to Aram* indicates that God is sovereign over all nations
and history.

**Important . . . highly regarded** **(v. 1).** Two terms describe
Naaman, commander of the army of Aram. First, Naaman was *important *to
his master, the king of Aram. Second, Naaman was *highly regarded*. The
Hebrew term for *important* conveys the idea of greatness. It can refer
to greatness in physical size, quantity, degree, or social status. In
this context, Naaman was a powerful warrior and military leader on whom
the king of Aram depended. *Highly regarded* means to be lifted up, and
it further emphasizes Naaman’s greatness and importance. Naaman was not
just great in the senses of his authority and power; he was also held in
high esteem by the king, the military, and most likely the people of
Aram.

In a subtle reminder that God is sovereign even over the affairs of
non-Israelites, the reason that Naaman was both important and highly
regarded was because through him, the Lord had given victory to Aram.
While the king and others elevated Naaman because of his military
ability and accomplishments, the Lord was ultimately responsible for
Naaman’s power and influence.

**Skin disease** **(v. 1).** While the Hebrew term can be translated as
“leprosy,” the generic phrase *skin disease* better conveys the meaning
of the Hebrew word because it is a collective term for a variety of
ailments of the skin. In short, we do not know with certainty the
precise nature of Naaman’s skin disease. However, from the immediate
context we can conclude that the skin disease was not so severe that it
prevented Naaman from performing his military and leadership duties.
However, we also know that the skin disease was significant enough for
the king of Aram to offer a huge amount of gold, silver, and clothing to
the king of Israel for Naaman to be healed (v. 5).

**A young girl who served** **(v. 2).** Naaman, “a valiant warrior” (v.
1), is contrasted with his wife’s young servant girl, an Israelite who
had been captured during an Aramean raid on Israel. This seemingly
powerless servant girl had knowledge concerning the prophet Elisha that
the mighty warrior Naaman did not. She knew this man of God could cure
Naaman’s skin disease.

**“Israel . . . Samaria”** **(vv. 2,3).** After the death of King
Solomon, the new king Rehoboam refused to lessen the hard service
Solomon had placed on the Israelites. So all the tribes of Israel,
except Judah and Benjamin, declared their independence under Jeroboam (1
Kings 12:1-17). The two nations were known as the Southern Kingdom of
Judah (under Rehoboam) and the Northern Kingdom of Israel (under
Jeroboam). Samaria, a city about forty-two miles from Jerusalem,
eventually became the capital of the Northern Kingdom.

In a figure of speech known as a synecdoche, where a small portion of a
larger thing is used to represent the whole (or vice versa), Samaria was
sometimes used as a synonym for the entire Northern Kingdom. So, in this
context the young servant girl was not necessarily claiming that she
knew Elisha was in the city of Samaria. Instead, she probably was saying
that Elisha lived and carried out his ministry in the Northern Kingdom
of Israel.

**2 Kings 5:10-12**

**10 Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, “Go wash seven times in
the Jordan and your skin will be restored and you will be clean.” 11 But
Naaman got angry and left, saying, “I was telling myself: He will surely
come out, stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his
hand over the place and cure the skin disease. 12 Aren’t Abana and
Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?
Couldn’t I wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and left in a
rage.**

**2 Kings 5:10-12 **Commentary

**Connection to the Point.** Elisha directed Naaman to wash in the
Jordan River, which initially offended Naaman.

**Context.** Naaman responded positively to the young servant’s
information by informing the king of Aram “what the girl from the land
of Israel had said” (v. 4). As a result, the king of Aram ordered Naaman
to go to Samaria with a letter to the king of Israel along with 750
pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold, and ten sets of clothing. The king
of Aram was fully invested in seeing the commander of his army healed.
The letter was extremely brief, simply saying that the Aramean king had
sent his servant Naaman for the Israelite king to cure him of his skin
disease (v. 6).

Upon receiving the letter, since he had no ability to cure a skin
disease, the king of Israel assumed that the Aramean king was trying to
start a war with him. The king of Israel tore his clothes in a sign of
grief and mourning. This response most likely reflects that Israel was
weaker than Aram and would have lost a war with the Arameans.

Upon hearing of the Israelite king’s response, the prophet Elisha sent a
message to the Israelite king that he was to send Naaman to the prophet.
Elisha had confidence that God would heal Naaman and therefore Naaman
(and the Arameans) would know that “there is a prophet in Israel” (v.
8), which is the same as stating God is in Israel. The miracle would
demonstrate to the Arameans that the Lord, the one true God, is more
powerful than anything—including Naaman’s skin disease.

**“Wash . . . in the Jordan”** **(v. 10).** The Jordan River served as a
geographical dividing line between the eastern and western tribes of
Israel. Elisha’s message to Naaman reflects the instructions God gave
concerning ritual cleansing in Leviticus 13–14. The Hebrew term for
*wash* appears in Leviticus 14:8-9; the term for *will be clean* appears
about twenty times in relation to skin diseases.

**“Restored”** **(v. 10).** The meaning of this Hebrew word is “to turn
back” or “return.” The term is associated with restoration (Gen. 40:13),
returning (8:12), and repentance (1 Kings 8:47). In this context, there
is probably a connection between ceremonial washing and both repentance
and restoration.

**Angry** **(v. 11).** By instructing Naaman to wash himself in the
Jordan River, Elisha was having Naaman perform a ritual cleansing that
likely would have been humiliating for him. After all, from Naaman’s
perspective the Jordan River was a small river in an insignificant and
weak country, and he was a great warrior, a servant of a king, and part
of the elite in his country.

The Hebrew word for *angry* is connected to the idea of wrath. Naaman
was not merely annoyed or frustrated with Elisha’s suggestion. It
angered him to the point of being wrathful. Naaman was angered for at
least two reasons. First, he had expected Elisha to come out and see him
personally rather than only sending out his servant with a message.
Second, he expected Elisha to do something spectacular rather than
merely having Naaman perform a ritual washing in a local river.

**“He will surely come out”** **(v. 11).** Naaman’s words reflect at
least two concerns. First, he was a powerful and important man of Aram,
demonstrated by his arrival at Elisha’s door with an entourage of horses
and chariots (v. 9). The presence of a man of such a high social status
called for a greeting equal to his importance. Elisha’s use of a
messenger rather than coming himself to greet someone of Naaman’s
stature would have been insulting.

Second, from Naaman’s perspective the God of the Israelites was a local
deity who was manipulated by His prophet, Elisha. He had expected Elisha
to greet him personally and work magic to heal him. This is reflected in
his words, “He will surely come out, stand and call on the name of the
Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the skin
disease.” Instead of humbly accepting what God had instructed him to do
through Elisha, Naaman tried to control the situation (and by extension
manipulate the God of the Israelites).

**“Abana and Pharpar”** **(v. 12).** These are two rivers near Damascus
in Naaman’s homeland of Aram. The reason for Naaman’s desire to wash in
those two rivers rather than the Jordan is not stated. Some suggest
these two rivers may have been clearer compared to the muddy Jordan
River, while others note Naaman’s desire may have been an expression of
national pride and/or familiarity with his homeland.

**2 Kings 5:14-17 **

**14 So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times,
according to the command of the man of God. Then his skin was restored
and became like the skin of a small boy, and he was clean. 15 Then
Naaman and his whole company went back to the man of God, stood before
him, and declared, “I know there’s no God in the whole world except in
Israel. Therefore, please accept a gift from your servant.” 16 But
Elisha said, “As the Lord lives, in whose presence I stand, I will not
accept it.” Naaman urged him to accept it, but he refused. 17 Naaman
responded, “If not, please let your servant be given as much soil as a
pair of mules can carry, for your servant will no longer offer a burnt
offering or a sacrifice to any other god but the Lord.**

**2 Kings 5:14-17 **Commentary

**Connection to the Point.** Naaman humbled himself, washed in the
Jordan River, and was healed.

**Clean** **(v. 14). **The meaning of the Hebrew word translated *clean*
is not merely something that has been washed off. Instead, it has a
deeper and more wholistic meaning—something like “pure.” It is used in
the senses of both ceremonial (Num. 8:15) and moral purity (Josh.
22:17). The laws of Leviticus and Deuteronomy taught that impure people
were not able to enter the tabernacle (the presence of the Lord). Jews
who heard or read the story of Naaman would have had this distinction
between pure and impure in mind.

Naaman’s outward healing from the skin disease was vitally important to
his life. However, the more important transformation happened in
Naaman’s heart, as demonstrated by his words, “I know there’s no God *in
the whole world* except in Israel” (2 Kings 5:15, emphasis added). This
confession of the exclusivity of Yahweh (“the Lord”) is remarkable given
that Naaman was a man of high standing from a pagan background where
people believed in and worshiped a pantheon of gods and goddesses. By
making this profession of faith in the presence of both Elisha and
Naaman’s entire entourage, the healed man was rejecting his past pagan
beliefs and declaring his allegiance to Yahweh alone.

**“Please accept a gift”** **(v. 15).** Naaman’s response to his being
cured was to offer a gift to the prophet of God. However, just as Elisha
had downplayed his role and elevated God by not personally coming out to
greet Naaman and not personally performing the miracle of healing
Naaman, now he did the same by refusing Naaman’s offering of a gift. It
was God who had healed Naaman, and it was God alone to whom Naaman
should have been thankful for being cured.

**“Soil”** **(v. 17).** Naaman wanted to take two loads of dirt from
Yahweh’s special land to construct an altar for worship in his homeland.
This territorial understanding of deities was common in the ancient Near
East, as was the transportation of the dirt from a deity’s territory
(essentially transporting “land” over which a deity ruled into the
territory of another god). While Naaman’s words indicate an incomplete
understanding of who the Lord is—the one true God of all creation—still
his faith was directed exclusively toward the Lord.

**Bonus Content**

Recipe ACTIVITY (OPTIONAL): **In advance,** bring a recipe for a food
you like to the meeting and read it to the group. Discuss what might be
some ways the dish could be ruined by not following the instructions.
For instance, “The recipe calls for the spaghetti to be boiled for
eleven minutes. Boiling the spaghetti for only two minutes would ruin
the dish.” Use this activity to emphasize the importance of following
God’s commands.

Hand Sanitizer ACTIVITY (OPTIONAL): **In advance, **bring hand sanitizer
to your gathering and close the session by passing it around the group.
Encourage everyone to use the sanitizer on their hands. Ask them to
consider what it means to be truly clean. Then invite them to confess
sin and commit to obedient living.
