Session 4

God’s Hand in Restoring Lives

The Point

God restores us as we are obedient to Him.

Life Connection

There is no limit to what God can do! The truth of that statement might
make us think of the most grand and glorious things He has done, such as
the creation of the universe and the resurrection of Christ. God also
works through what the world might consider the smallest and least
significant things. God works as we trust and obey Him.

The Passage

2 Kings 5:1-3,10-19a

The Setting

The verses for this session comprise one of the most familiar stories
not only in the Elisha episodes but in the entirety of 1 and 2 Kings. It
is one of the most detailed of the Elisha miracle accounts, even
exceeding that of the resuscitation of the child of Shunem.

> God desires that we be made whole, restored to a right relationship
> with Him. And He makes it possible. That calls for us to listen to His
> Word; accept His Word; and obediently submit to His Word. Those are
> three essential elements on the pathway of divine restoration.

Getting started

**Discuss: **Draw attention to the question on **PSG, page 139** and ask
**Question 1: When have you misjudged a book by its cover?**

**Guide:** Refer the group to **"The Bible Meets Life"** **(PSG, page
139)** to summarize the author’s story about Susan Boyle. Emphasize
Simon Cowell’s statement “never judge a book by its cover” and what that
means.

**Say:** One of God’s great qualities is His ability to look at the
heart of an individual, not just their outward appearance. Nowhere
within the realm of Christianity is this ability more important than in
the area of restoration.

**Guide:** Introduce **The Point** on **PSG, page 139: God restores us
as we are obedient to Him.**

**Optional Introduction: **Refer to "Life Connection" on page 142 for an
alternate introduction to the study.

**Pray:** Begin the session with prayer. Ask God to use this session to
demonstrate His power to save and to reveal His choice to often work
through the unexpected and unlikely. Ask God to guide the group towards
humble obedience.

Study the Bible

2 Kings 5:1-3

1 Naaman, commander of the army for the king of Aram, was a man
important to his master and highly regarded because through him,
the Lord had given victory to Aram. The man was a valiant warrior, but
he had a skin disease. 2 Aram had gone on raids and brought back from
the land of Israel a young girl who served Naaman’s wife.  
3 She said to her mistress, “If only my master were with the prophet who
is in Samaria, he would cure him of his skin disease.”

**Summarize:** Before reading the verses, refer to “The Setting” on page

**guide: **Share the author's observations on **PSG, pp. 140–141**: Use
the author’s comments to establish God’s choice to work through an
unlikely source.

A young Israelite girl, a servant of Naaman’s wife, made known that a
prophet in Israel who could cure Naaman of his disease. This was God’s
hand at work through an unlikely person.

God’s word tells us that God often works through the small, the lowly,
the weak. God works through unlikely people.

**Recap:** Share the story of Ed Kimball (PSG, p. 141), a shoe salesman
and a Sunday school teacher, who was an unlikely person who God used.

people.

**Transition:** A potential cure for his skin disease was good news to
Naaman’s ears but he had to take action.

2 Kings 5:1-3 Commentary

**Aram** (v. 1). Aram was a loose confederation of cities and towns
sometimes referred to as Syria; it is also referred to by its most
prominent city, Damascus. The Old Testament mentions people from Aram on
several occasions. Deuteronomy 26:5 indicates Jacob and by extension
Abraham were Arameans. The father of Rebekah, Isaac’s wife, was “Bethuel
the Aramean of Paddan-aram” (Gen. 25:20). Arameans played a role in Old
Testament history (for example: 2 Sam. 8:5-6; 10:8-19; 1 Kings 11:25;
20:1-29).

> The shift in focus from the prophet Elisha (2 Kings 4) to the Aramean
> Naaman (chap. 5) emphasizes that God’s focus was not limited to the
> descendants of Abraham; God’s intention was always to bless all the
> nations of the earth through Abraham (Gen. 12:1-3). That *the Lord had
> given victory to Aram* indicates that God is sovereign over all
> nations and history.

**Important . . . highly regarded** (v. 1). Two terms describe Naaman,
commander of the army of Aram. First, Naaman was *important *to his
master, the king of Aram. The Hebrew term for *important* conveys the
idea of greatness. It can refer to greatness in physical size, quantity,
degree, or social status. In this context, Naaman was a powerful warrior
and military leader on whom the king of Aram depended. Second, Naaman
was *highly regarded* which means to be lifted up. It further emphasizes
Naaman’s greatness and importance. Naaman was also held in high esteem
by the king, the military, and most likely the people of Aram.

> In a subtle reminder that God is sovereign even over the affairs of
> non-Israelites, the reason that Naaman was both important and highly
> regarded was because through him, the Lord had given victory to Aram.
> While the king and others elevated Naaman because of his military
> ability and accomplishments, the Lord was ultimately responsible for
> Naaman’s power and influence.

**Skin disease** (v. 1). While the Hebrew term can be translated as
“leprosy,” the generic phrase *skin disease* better conveys the meaning
of the Hebrew word because it is a collective term for a variety of
ailments of the skin. In short, we do not know with certainty the
precise nature of Naaman’s skin disease. However, from the immediate
context we can conclude that the skin disease was not so severe that it
prevented Naaman from performing his military and leadership duties.
However, we also know that the skin disease was significant enough for
the king of Aram to offer a huge amount of gold, silver, and clothing to
the king of Israel for Naaman to be healed (v. 5).

**A young girl who served** (v. 2). Naaman, “a valiant warrior” (v. 1),
is contrasted with his wife’s young servant girl, an Israelite who had
been captured during an Aramean raid on Israel. This seemingly powerless
servant girl had knowledge concerning the prophet Elisha that the mighty
warrior Naaman did not. She knew this man of God could cure Naaman’s
skin disease.

**Israel . . . Samaria** (vv. 2,3). After the death of King Solomon, the
new king Rehoboam refused to lessen the hard service Solomon had placed
on the Israelites. So all the tribes of Israel except Judah and Benjamin
declared their independence under Jeroboam (1 Kings 12:1-17). The two
nations were known as the Southern Kingdom of Judah (under Rehoboam) and
the Northern Kingdom of Israel (under Jeroboam). Samaria, a city about
forty-two miles from Jerusalem, eventually became the capital of the
Northern Kingdom.

> In a figure of speech known as a synecdoche, where a small portion of
> a larger thing is used to represent the whole (or vice versa), Samaria
> was sometimes used as a synonym for the entire Northern Kingdom. So,
> in this context the young servant girl was not necessarily claiming
> that she knew Elisha was in the city of Samaria. Instead, she probably
> was saying that Elisha lived and carried out his ministry in the
> Northern Kingdom of Israel.

2 Kings 5:10-12

10 Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, “Go wash seven times in
the Jordan and your skin will be restored and you will be clean.”  
11 But Naaman got angry and left, saying, “I was telling myself: He will
surely come out, stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and
wave his hand over the place and cure the skin disease.  
12 Aren’t Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the
waters of Israel? Couldn’t I wash in them and be clean?” So he turned
and left in a rage.

**Read:** Enlist a volunteer to read 2 Kings 5:10-12.

**say:** Share this connection to The Point: God’s commands always
require obedience.

**Recap:** Share the author's observations on **PSG, p. 143 **to
underscore the importance of obedience in God’s restorative process.

Naaman was offended by Elisha's directive. It insulted his sense of
self-worth and pride. So he left in a rage. His pride led him to
disobedience.

God’s commands always require obedience. I know that’s a simple
statement but obviously we humans need to hear it on a regular basis. In
the Old Testament God’s people knew God’s commands but they didn’t obey
them. Some of Jesus’ sharpest words were to the religious leaders of His
day that knew the commands of God yet refused to obey them.

The irony of our disobedience is that God’s commands are really for our
good.

**say: **Regardless of how big or small God’s command, it’s always in
our best interest to obey.

**Summarize:** Refer to the **Bible Commentary** to illustrate the
barriers of anger and pride that prevented Naaman from being obedient.

****Angry ****(v. 11).

****He will surely come out ****(v. 11).

**Rage **(v. 12).

**Discuss:** **Question 3: When have you seen pride get in the way of
obedience?**

**Alternate Question: **How do you typically respond when you feel God
leading you in a direction you don’t understand?

**Transition:** It’s unwise to demand that God work in a specific way
and according to our expectations. All it does is set us up to disobey
and, ultimately, be denied restoration and healing. To Naaman’s credit,
he swallowed his pride and listened to wise counsel and it changed his
life forever. All because he did one thing: he obeyed.

2 Kings 5:10-12 Commentary

**Context.** Naaman responded positively to the young servant’s
information by informing the king of Aram “what the girl from the land
of Israel had said” (v. 4). The king of Aram ordered Naaman to go to
Samaria with a letter to the king of Israel along with 750 pounds of
silver, 150 pounds of gold, and ten sets of clothing. The letter was
brief, simply saying that the Aramean king had sent his servant Naaman
for the Israelite king to cure him of his skin disease (v. 6).

> Upon receiving the letter, the king of Israel assumed that the Aramean
> king was trying to start a war with him. The king of Israel tore his
> clothes in a sign of grief and mourning. This response most likely
> reflects that Israel was weaker than Aram and would have lost a war
> with the Arameans. Upon hearing of the Israelite king’s response, the
> prophet Elisha sent a message to the Israelite king that he was to
> send Naaman to the prophet. Elisha had confidence that God would heal
> Naaman and therefore Naaman would know that “there is a prophet in
> Israel” (v. 8). The miracle would demonstrate to the Arameans that the
> Lord, the one true God, is more powerful than anything—including
> Naaman’s skin disease.

**Wash . . . in the Jordan** (v. 10). The Jordan River served as a
geographical dividing line between the eastern and western tribes of
Israel. The longest river in Israel (more than two hundred miles), it
flows from Mount Hermon in the north down to the Dead Sea. Elisha’s
message to Naaman reflects the instructions God gave concerning ritual
cleansing in Leviticus 13–14. The Hebrew term for *wash *appears in
Leviticus 14:8-9; the term for *will be clean* appears about twenty
times in the two chapters in relation to skin diseases.

**Seven times** (v. 10). By instructing Naaman to wash himself seven
times in the Jordan River, Elisha was looking for complete obedience to
his instructions for Naaman. If Naaman followed the instructions God
would heal him.

**Restored** (v. 10). The meaning of this Hebrew word is “to turn back”
or “return.” The term is associated with restoration (Gen. 40:13),
returning (8:12), and repentance (1 Kings 8:47). In this context, there
is probably a connection between ceremonial washing and restoration.

**Angry** (v. 11). By instructing Naaman to wash himself in the Jordan
River, Elisha was having Naaman perform a ritual cleansing in a a small
river in an insignificant and weak country, and he was a great warrior,
a servant of a king, and part of the elite in his country. The Hebrew
word for *angry* is connected to the idea of wrath. Naaman was not
merely annoyed or frustrated with Elisha’s suggestion. Naaman was
angered because he had expected Elisha to come out and see him
personally rather than sending out his servant with a message. He
expected Elisha to do something spectacular rather than merely having
Naaman perform a ritual washing.

**He will surely come out** (v. 11). Naaman’s was a powerful and
important man of Aram, demonstrated by his arrival at Elisha’s door with
an entourage of horses and chariots (v. 9). The presence of a man of
such a high social status called for a greeting equal to his importance.
Elisha’s use of a messenger rather than coming himself to greet someone
of Naaman’s stature and power would have been seen as an insult. From
Naaman’s perspective, the God of the Israelites was a local deity who
was manipulated by His prophet, Elisha. He had expected Elisha to greet
him personally and work magic to heal him. Instead of humbly accepting
what God had instructed him to do through Elisha, Naaman acted
arrogantly and tried to control the situation (and by extension
manipulate the God of the Israelites).

**Rage** (v. 12). The Hebrew term for *rage* could also be translated
“burning anger” and comes from a root word meaning “heat” or “to become
hot.” For the reasons stated above, Naaman’s blood was figuratively
boiling over both from Elisha’s treatment of him and the prophet’s
instructions. Rather than obey, Naaman stormed away in a rage.

2 Kings 5:13-19a

13 But his servants approached and said to him, “My father, if the
prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it?
How much more should you do it when he only tells you, ‘Wash and be
clean’?” 14 So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven
times, according to the command of the man of God. Then his skin was
restored and became like the skin of a small boy, and he was clean. 15
Then Naaman and his whole company went back to the man of God, stood
before him, and declared, “I know there’s no God in the whole world
except in Israel. Therefore, please accept a gift from your servant.” 16
But Elisha said, “As the Lord lives, in whose presence I stand, I will
not accept it.” Naaman urged him to accept it, but he refused. 17 Naaman
responded, “If not, please let your servant be given as much soil as a
pair of mules can carry, for your servant will no longer offer a burnt
offering or a sacrifice to any other god but the Lord. 18 However, in a
particular matter may the Lord pardon your servant: When my master, the
king of Aram, goes into the temple of Rimmon to bow in worship while he
is leaning on my arm, and I have to bow in the temple of Rimmon—when I
bow in the temple of Rimmon, may the Lord pardon your servant in this
matter.”  
19a So he said to him, “Go in peace.”

2 Kings 5:13-19a Commentary

**My father** (v. 13). The servants speaking to Naaman in this verse
were not Naaman’s children. The use of familial language to imply a
close relationship is common in the Bible and in many cultures around
the world today. The use of familial language has already been seen in
the relationship between Elijah and Elisha. Elisha referred to Elijah as
“my father” (2 Kings 2:12). Additionally, the “sons of the prophets”
mentioned in 1 and 2 Kings were not biological sons of the prophets.
Instead they were members of a prophetic order or guild under the
leadership and guidance of a more spiritually mature man of God whom
they called “master” (vv. 3,5). In a similar way, the servants speaking
to Naaman were addressing him respectfully and acknowledging their
subservience to him.

**Clean** (v. 13). The meaning of the Hebrew word translated *clean* has
a deeper and more wholistic meaning than something that has been washed
off. It indicates something as “pure.” It is used in the senses of both
ceremonial (Num. 8:15) and moral purity (Josh. 22:17). The laws of
Leviticus and Deuteronomy taught that impure people were not able to
enter the tabernacle. Jews who heard the story of Naaman would have had
this distinction between pure and impure in mind.

> Naaman’s outward healing from the skin disease was vitally important
> to his life. However, the more important transformation happened in
> Naaman’s heart, as demonstrated by his words, “I know there’s no God
> *in the whole world* except in Israel” (2 Kings 5:15, emphasis added).
> This confession of the exclusivity of Yahweh (“the Lord”) is
> remarkable given that Naaman was a man of high standing from a pagan
> background where people believed in and worshiped a pantheon of gods
> and goddesses. By making this profession of faith in the presence of
> both Elisha and Naaman’s entire entourage, the healed man was
> rejecting his past pagan beliefs and declaring his allegiance to
> Yahweh alone.

**Please accept a gift** (v. 15). Naaman’s response to his being cured
was to offer a gift to the prophet of God. However, just as Elisha had
downplayed his role and elevated God by not personally coming out to
greet Naaman and not personally performing the miracle of healing
Naaman, now he did the same by refusing Naaman’s offering of a gift. It
was God who had healed Naaman, and it was God alone to whom Naaman
should have been thankful for being cured.

**Soil** (v. 17). Naaman wanted to take two loads of dirt from Yahweh’s
special land to construct an altar for worship in his homeland. This
territorial understanding of deities was common in the ancient Near
East, as was the transportation of the dirt from a deity’s territory
(essentially transporting “land” over which a deity ruled into the
territory of another god). While Naaman’s words indicate an incomplete
understanding of who the Lord is—the one true God of all creation—still
his faith was directed exclusively toward the Lord.

**The temple of Rimmon** (v. 18).* Rimmon* was the chief Syrian god
associated with storms and thunder. Despite his new-found faith,
Naaman’s duties for the king of Aram included accompanying the king into
Rimmon’s temple when the king worshiped the pagan god.

**Leaning on my arm** (v. 18). This expression most likely refers to a
ceremonial responsibility Naaman had as the commander of the Aramean
army. Naaman told Elisha that he would not be participating in worship
in these situations but rather simply be accompanying his king.

**Go in peace **(v. 19). With these words, Elisha indicated that
Naaman’s heart orientation toward God was correct. Naaman had declared
that there is no God other than Yahweh, and he would only offer
sacrifices to and worship Him (v. 17). Elisha acknowledged that while
Naaman’s duties dictated that he had to enter the temple of Rimmon with
the Aramean king, the healed man would not be participating in the
worship of the false god.

Live It Out

**Review: Live It Out (PSG, page 147).** Encourage the group to follow
through this week with at least one of the applications.

Restoration through obedience is an ongoing pursuit. Choose one or more
of the activities below to help you move through the process.

  
*****Review.***** Write down ways you demonstrate obedience to God
during your weekly routine. Beside each one, list a benefit you receive
from your obedience.

*****  
Request.***** Spend time in prayer asking God to show you areas in your
life where obedience is a struggle. Pay close attention to those areas
where pride can become a barrier. Choose one area and make it a matter
of ongoing prayer.

*****  
Restore.***** Enlist a brother or sister in Christ to hold you
accountable for your obedience in an area in which it is difficult to
obey. Schedule meetings and give them permission to speak truthfully to
you.

Wrap It Up

**guide:** Emphasize **The Point: God restores us as we are obedient to
Him.**

**Guide:** Remind the group that God always responds positively to our
obedience. And humble obedience sets the stage for God to do His
greatest work: restoration.

**Pray:** Lord, forgive us when we’ve demanded that You work in
particular ways or in agreement with our expectations. Help us to trust
in Your wisdom to always do what is best for us and to recognize Your
grace that makes Your good and perfect will available even in the midst
of our sin. Thank You for Your restoration.

Engage

Prayerfully consider yourself in these areas. Respond with one  
of the following:

**1= None/Never 5= Sometimes/Irregularly 10= Always/Consistently **

\_\_\_\_ I have seen God at work in my life.

\_\_\_\_ When I need healing, I look to God with my hope and requests.

\_\_\_\_ I trust God’s sovereignty in life, death, sickness, and
healing.

\_\_\_\_ When it’s clear that God has given a command, I am willing to
obey.

\_\_\_\_ I am careful to obey God in “big decisions” of life.

\_\_\_\_ From my heart, I want to obey God fully.

\_\_\_\_ Peace has come in my life as a result of obeying God.

Mark the areas where you’d like to grow more mature. Write a prayer
expressing your willingness to obey, and ask for the help, trust, and
peace that you need.

Bonus Content (Optional)

**Optional Activity:** Write on a white board: God uses unlikely people
for His purposes. Invite the group to create a list of Bible characters
and stories that align with this statement (It may help to prompt the
group by writing some of the following names on the white board: King
David, Gideon the prophet, Mary the mother of Jesus, and Saul/Paul).

Say, “Each one of these people was used by God. What made each one of
them an unlikely participant in God’s plan?” Use this exercise to affirm
that God uses unlikely people for His purposes.
