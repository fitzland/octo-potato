### **Phase 5: Actionable Implementation (The Setup)**

**1. Icebreaker: "The Weirdest Cure"**
*   **The Question:** "What is the strangest 'home remedy' or piece of medical advice you have ever received or tried? Did it work?"
*   **The Connection:** Today we are going to look at a powerful General who was given a prescription that sounded absolutely ridiculous to him—dip in a muddy river seven times. We will see how his reaction to the "weird cure" reveals the condition of his heart.

**2. Opening Prayer**
*   *Suggestion:* "Lord, we ask that You strip away our titles and our pride for the next hour. Open our eyes to see where we are broken, and give us the courage to step into the waters of obedience, even when it doesn't make sense to us. Amen."

### **The Lesson Outline**

#### **Introduction: The "Successful but Suffering" Paradox**
*   **Read:** 2 Kings 5:1.
*   **The Hook:** We live in a culture that tells us if we achieve enough, we will be okay. Naaman proves this wrong.
*   **The Contrast:** He was a commander, a "great man," highly regarded, and wealthy. **BUT** he was a leper.
*   **The Truth:** External success cannot cure internal brokenness. Everyone in this room has a "but"—a place of hurt or sin that money and reputation cannot fix.

#### **Part 1: The Unlikely Messenger (Recognizing Our Need)**
*   **Read:** 2 Kings 5:2–4.
*   **The Twist:** The solution doesn't come from the King or the General. It comes from a young, captive servant girl.
*   **The Character:** She displays selfless love. Instead of hating her captor, she points him to life.
*   **Discussion Question #1:** "Why do you think successful people often struggle to seek help for their deepest needs?"
    *   *Teaching Note:* Discuss the "Success Trap"—the fear that admitting weakness invalidates our strength.

#### **Part 2: The Obstacle of Pride (God’s Way vs. My Way)**
*   **Read:** 2 Kings 5:9–12.
*   **The Conflict:** Naaman expects a show (waving hands, royal greeting). Elisha sends a messenger with a mundane instruction: "Wash in the Jordan."
*   **The Offense:** Naaman is furious. The Jordan is small and muddy compared to the rivers of Damascus. He feels insulted.
*   **The Principle:** God’s methods often offend our dignity to reveal our dependency.
*   **Discussion Question #2:** "Naaman had to travel to 'enemy territory' and wash in a 'muddy river' for healing. What uncomfortable place might God be calling you to for your restoration?"
    *   *Prompts:* Is it apologizing? Counseling? Serving in a lowly spot?

#### **Part 3: The Process of Restoration (Simple Obedience)**
*   **Read:** 2 Kings 5:13–14.
*   **The Logic:** His servants ask, "If he asked you to do a great thing, would you not have done it?"
*   **The Healing:** Naaman dips seven times. His flesh is restored "like a young boy."
*   **The Theology:** The "Great Man" had to become like a "Little Child" to be healed. (Connect to Matthew 18:3).
*   **Discussion Question #3:** "What is harder for us: doing something 'great' for God, or maintaining simple, daily obedience? Why?"
*   **Discussion Question #5 (The Reset):** "The text says Naaman’s flesh was restored 'like that of a young boy.' Spiritual restoration isn't just fixing a problem; it's a total reset. What specific area of your life needs a 'reset' to childlike faith rather than just a 'repair'?"

#### **Part 4: The Warning (The Danger of False Value)**
*   **Read:** 2 Kings 5:20–27 (Summarize the exchange).
*   **The Tragedy:** Naaman offers money; Elisha refuses (Grace is free). Gehazi, the servant, chases Naaman to get the silver.
*   **The Swap:** Naaman (the outsider) leaves with peace; Gehazi (the insider) is left with leprosy.
*   **Discussion Question #4:** "Gehazi lived with the prophet, saw the miracles, and knew the truth, yet he still chased the money. How is it possible to be 'close to the fire' of God's work and still remain cold or corrupt in our hearts?"

### **Conclusion: The Weekly Challenge**

**"The Humility Check"**
Identify one "small thing" you have been avoiding because you feel it is beneath you or a waste of time (e.g., writing a thank you note, apologizing first, doing a menial chore). Do it this week without announcing it to anyone.

**Closing Prayer**
"Father, thank You for the story of Naaman, which reminds us that Your grace is available to all who humble themselves. Forgive us for the times we have been like Naaman—demanding a spectacular miracle while refusing simple obedience. And warn our hearts against the spirit of Gehazi—that we would never trade our integrity for temporary gain. Wash us clean, and restore to us the heart of a child. In Jesus’ name, Amen."
