Session 5

**God’s Hand in Facing Opposition**

The Point

God is more powerful than those who oppose us.

The Passage

2 Kings 6:8-12,15-23

Life Connection

The world is at war and every human being is involved in the conflict.
But this isn’t a war of country against country; it’s a spiritual
battle. As believers, we often don’t think in these terms; however, only
by realizing we’re in this fight can we stand in Christ against Satan
and his wiles. Thankfully, we don’t stand alone. God Himself stands with
us whenever we face opposition.

\***NOTE:** Use “Jesus and Elisha: A Comparison” on page 156 to
supplement your wrap up of this unit on Elisha.

Background

Knowing that Elisha was thwarting his battle plans, the king of Aram
sought to capture the prophet. He received intelligence that Elisha was
in Dothan, so the king dispatched a massive army by night to seize the
prophet. The scene is somewhat humorous and ironic. Since God had
revealed all the previous plans of the king of Aram to Elisha, what made
the Aramean king think his plan to capture the prophet would escape
God’s notice this time?

One of the reasons the king of Aram did not understand who he was
dealing with was due to his bad theology—he did not understand the
nature of Almighty God. The false gods he worshiped were merely idols,
blocks of stone and wood. They were powerless. In contrast, the one true
God is omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing), and
omnipresent (capable of being present everywhere at once). Nothing
escapes His notice. Therefore, the king of Aram’s plan to capture Elisha
was doomed from the start. The king’s futile attempt to silence the
prophet Elisha is reminiscent of attempts made to capture or kill the
prophet Elijah  
(1 Kings 19:1-2; 2 Kings 1:9-15).

Getting started

Discuss: Give your group an opportunity to discuss **Question \#1 **on
page 135 of the Daily Discipleship Guide (DDG): **What’s your favorite
come-from-behind, feel-good story?**

Recap (DDG, page 136): Invite a volunteer to read **The Bible Meets
Life** to introduce the session:

In the movie *Little Giants*, a group of misfit kids form their own
football team after being cut from a local team of all-stars­—the
Cowboys. The movie ends with the Little Giants defeating the Cowboys,
not through strength and dominance, but through creativity and luck. The
story carries a message of being strong and united, even when feeling
small. The opposition we face isn’t always apparent, but it’s real.
Thankfully, we don’t stand alone.

GUIDE: Direct attention to **The Point** on page 136 of the DDG. Invite
the group to fill in the blank<sup>:</sup> **God is more powerful than
those who *****OPPOSE***** us. **

PRAY: Transition into the study by asking God to help us remember that
we don’t stand alone when we face opposition.

STUDY the BIBLE

**2 Kings 6:8-12**

**8 When the king of Aram was waging war against Israel, he conferred
with his servants, “My camp will be at such and such a place.” 9 But the
man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Be careful passing by this
place, for the Arameans are going down there.” 10 Consequently, the king
of Israel sent word to the place the man of God had told him about. The
man of God repeatedly warned the king, so the king would be on his
guard. 11 The king of Aram was enraged because of this matter, and he
called his servants and demanded of them, “Tell me, which one of us is
for the king of Israel?” 12 One of his servants said, “No one, my lord
the king. Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel even
the words you speak in your bedroom.”**

**2 Kings 6:8-12 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **Elisha informed the king of Israel of the
actions of the Aramean army.

**King of Aram** **(v. 8).** Previously, the king of Israel had
mistakenly feared the king of Aram (Syria) was trying to goad him into a
conflict (5:7). Now, the two nations were at war. At this time, Aram’s
military was probably stronger than that of Israel. This was suggested
earlier when the king of Israel thought the king of Aram was trying to
pick a fight with him by requesting he heal Naaman’s skin disease; the
Israelite king tore his clothes, an expression of grief and mourning,
acknowledging that his kingdom could not win against the might of the
Arameans.

In both instances, neither the king of Aram nor the king of Israel
understood the nature and power of God. While that is not surprising for
a pagan king, what is shocking is the king of Israel’s lack of
understanding. His role was to lead God’s people in a covenant
relationship with Yahweh, the God of Israel. Instead, he viewed life
from an earthly, human perspective.

**Waging war** **(v. 8). **King David successfully defeated and occupied
Aram (2 Samuel 8:5-6; 10:6-19), but during the time of King Solomon, the
Arameans waged war against Israel (1 Kings 11:25). Then when Israel
split into the Northern Kingdom of Israel (Samaria) and the Southern
Kingdom of Judah after Solomon’s death, the Arameans took advantage of
the weaknesses that came with the nation’s division. The relationship
between Aram and the two kingdoms would continue—sometimes as enemies,
sometimes as allies—until the Assyrians conquered Aram and deported the
Arameans in 732 BC. It has been suggested by Bible students that the
type of warfare referenced here are raids and ambushes by the Arameans.

The true strength of the Israelites was not their army, but rather their
God. In a somewhat amusing scenario, every time the king of Aram made a
military decision related to the conflict with the kingdom of Israel,
God revealed the king’s plans to the prophet Elijah, who then warned the
king of Israel. As a result, Israel’s army was able to evade the Aramean
army’s attempted ambushes. So, while the two countries were at war, very
little actual fighting took place.

**Enraged (v. 11).** The king of Aram became enraged, believing one of
his servants was revealing his plans to the king of Israel. The literal
meaning of the Hebrew term refers to a great wind or a violent storm. In
much the same way hurricane winds rage, the king of Aram got stirred up
because he believed one of his servants was betraying him.

**“My lord”** **(v. 12).** The Hebrew word for the covenant name of God,
*Yahweh*, is indicated in the Old Testament by the word “Lord.” In this
instance, the word translated “lord” does not refer to God. The servant
in this verse was identifying the Aramean king as his master or ruler,
recognizing his authority over the servant.

**“Your bedroom”** **(v. 12).** The servant explained that none of the
king’s people were betraying him. Rather, it was Elisha who knew all the
king’s plans, even the most private conversations the king had in his
most intimate space, his bedroom. Elisha’s knowledge about all the
Aramean king’s plans was not due to human informants or double agents
embedded in their army. Rather, Elisha had access to the king of Aram’s
plans through supernatural means. Yahweh, the God of Israel, revealed
those plans to the prophet, who then related them to the king of Israel.

**2 Kings 6:15-17**

**15 When the servant of the man of God got up early and went out, he
discovered an army with horses and chariots surrounding the city. So he
asked Elisha, “Oh, my master, what are we to do?” 16 Elisha said, “Don’t
be afraid, for those who are with us outnumber those who are with them.”
17 Then Elisha prayed, “Lord, please open his eyes and let him see.” So
the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he saw that the mountain was
covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.**

> TRANSITION: In the next verses, we see the importance of being kind
> and gracious to those who oppose us.

**2 Kings 6:15-17 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **God protected His people with an unseen
army.

**The servant of the man of God** **(v. 15).** In this instance, the
name of the servant of Elisha is not given. Based on 2 Kings 8:4-5,
where he is explicitly named as Gehazi, this servant is likely the same
person who appeared in the earlier account related to the Aramean
commander, Naaman (2 Kings 5). In that episode, Gehazi approached Naaman
after the commander of the Aramean military had been cured of his skin
disease. While Elisha refused the reward Naaman offered for being cured,
Gehazi took the reward for himself. After being confronted by Elisha and
lying about his actions, Gehazi was stricken with the same skin disease
that afflicted Naaman. The end of chapter 5 declares that Gehazi and his
descendants would perpetually have the same skin disease. Bible students
suggest that in an incredible example of the mercy of God, Gehazi was
not left in that diseased state; he was healed. In an equally incredible
example of the grace of God, Gehazi was restored to a place of honor,
serving Elisha, the man of God.

**“Those who are with us”** **(v. 16).** While human beings usually view
life in this world from a physical perspective, there is also a
spiritual realm that is just as real and is populated by spiritual
beings both good and evil. Just as human armies battle in the physical
world, spiritual armies wage war in this other realm. For example, when
the prophet Daniel prayed to understand a revelation he received from
God, an angel was dispatched to explain the meaning of the revelation to
the prophet. However, the angel was hindered for twenty-one days by an
evil spiritual being identified as “the prince of the kingdom of
Persia.” Only after the angel Michael came to assist the messenger angel
was he able to fulfill his mission to Daniel. The messenger also told
Daniel that when the angel left, the battle would continue as “the
prince of Greece” would join the prince of Persia against the messenger
angel and Michael (Daniel 10:10-21). Another reference to this spiritual
realm is made by Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane; He spoke of how, if
He asked, God the Father would put twelve legions of angels (seventy-two
thousand) at His disposal (Matthew 26:53).

**“Open his eyes”** **(v. 17). **Elisha’s request did not refer to his
servant’s physical eyes; his servant was not blind in the sense that he
wasn’t able to see the world around him. Instead, Elisha asked God to
give his servant spiritual eyes to see the true reality of their
situation. The servant’s natural reaction was to panic at the sight of
the massive Aramean army that surrounded Dothan. But Elisha, the prophet
of God, recognized that the omnipotent power of God was with him to
protect him and his servant.

**Horses and chariots of fire (v. 17).** These words identify the forces
sent by God to protect Elisha. They are a contrast to the relatively
feeble power of the king of Aram, who sent “horses, chariots, and a
massive army” to seize Elisha (v. 14). These horses and chariots of fire
recall the means by which the prophet Elijah had been taken up into
heaven in a whirlwind (2:11-12). Fire in both instances indicates the
presence of God.

**2 Kings 6:18-23**

**18 When the Arameans came against him, Elisha prayed to the Lord,
“Please strike this nation with blindness.” So he struck them with
blindness, according to Elisha’s word. 19 Then Elisha said to them,
“This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will
take you to the man you’re looking for.” And he led them to Samaria. 20
When they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “Lord, open these men’s eyes and
let them see.” So the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw that they
were in the middle of Samaria. 21 When the king of Israel saw them, he
said to Elisha, “Should I kill them, should I kill them, my father?” 22
Elisha replied, “Don’t kill them. Do you kill those you have captured
with your sword or your bow? Set food and water in front of them so they
can eat and drink and go to their master.” 23 So he prepared a big feast
for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they
went to their master. The Aramean raiders did not come into Israel’s
land again.**

**2 Kings 6:18-23 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **Under Elisha’s direction, the king of
Israel treated the captured army with mercy.

**“Strike this nation with blindness”** **(v. 18).** In contrast to
Elisha’s prayer that his servant’s eyes would be opened to see the host
God had sent to protect the prophet and his servant, Elisha now
addressed the Aramean army surrounding them. While Elisha and his
servant were protected by God’s horses and chariots of fire, Elisha went
a step further to protect the Israelites, asking God to strike the
Aramean army with blindness. God granted Elisha’s prayer, and the
Aramean army was rendered blind.

**“The man you’re looking for”** **(v. 19).** The Aramean soldiers were
sent by their king to go to Dothan to look for the troublemaker Elisha
and to capture him. Ironically, the man speaking to them and “helping”
them was the very man they were looking for! Yet, their blindness left
them unable to recognize that the man they were seeking was in front of
them. Instead of capturing Elisha, they were in effect his captives. The
man they were seeking guided them into the presence of the king of
Israel, where the Arameans were at the king’s mercy.

**Entered Samaria** **(v. 20).** Sometime after Israel split into two
nations with the death of King Solomon, Samaria became the capital of
the Northern Kingdom of Israel. It was located in the central highlands,
about forty-two miles north of Jerusalem. The city’s location on a hill
provided a military advantage. The Syrians twice laid siege to the city,
but it eventually fell to the Assyrians. When the Assyrians captured
Samaria, most of the residents were deported. Some of the remaining
Israelites intermarried with foreigners the Assyrians settled in the
region (17:24). Because of their intermarriage with Gentiles and their
syncretistic religion (mixing the worship of Yahweh with that of false
gods), a great animosity developed between the Samaritans and the Jews.

**King of Israel** **(v. 21).** The text does not name the specific king
of Israel involved in these events. Whatever his name, the account does
not portray him as a godly king and makes clear that it was not his
leadership that saved the people of Israel. Instead, it was God through
His power and His prophet Elisha who saved both the king and the people
of Israel from the army of Aram.

The kings of both the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the Southern
Kingdom of Judah often failed in their role as spiritual leaders of
their people. Although those two nations were called to be witnesses to
the world as God’s people, they often ended up living just like their
pagan neighbors.

**“My father”** **(v. 21).** While the king of Israel was the leader of
his people, in this instance he recognized Elisha, the prophet of God,
as his spiritual superior. The king looked to Elisha for permission to
do what he desired—to kill the captive Aramean soldiers who were at his
mercy. Instead of giving the king permission to kill the Aramean
soldiers, Elisha reasoned with the king that if these soldiers had been
taken captive in battle, the king would not have killed them. They would
have been taken as the spoils of war and enslaved.

**A big feast** **(v. 23).** When the king of Israel saw that the
Aramean soldiers were his helpless captives, he asked Elisha if he
should kill them. Instead of endorsing the king’s plan, Elisha
instructed the king to give the Arameans food and water and let the
soldiers return to their master, the king of Aram.

The Israelite king wanted to give the Aramean soldiers judgment and
death, which would have been the expected response. However, Elisha told
the king to offer them mercy and grace. Mercy is not receiving the
punishment deserved. Grace is being given benefits that are undeserved.
Instead of death, the Arameans were treated to a great feast.
