Session 1

God’s Hand in Calling Us to Serve

The Point

God invites us to join Him in His work.

Life Connection

We can be thankful for the way God calls and works through our pastors,
church leaders, and other gifted communicators. The same God who works
through them desires to work through each of us. The same God who called
them also calls each of us. Our response is to see where He is at work
and join Him in the task He calls us to.

The Passage

1 Kings 19:19-21; 2 Kings 2:7-15

The Setting

The events in 1 Kings 18 were the climax of the prophet Elijah’s
ministry. Elijah had challenged King Ahab to summon all the Israelites
along with all the prophets of the false gods Baal and Asherah to gather
at Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18:19). There the Lord through Elijah defeated
all the false prophets (vv. 20-40). Afterward, Ahab’s wife, Jezebel,
sent a messenger to Elijah who informed the prophet the queen was
planning to have him killed. Fearing for his life, Elijah fled into the
wilderness, and God brought him to Mount Horeb (19:1-9). At Mount Horeb,
God spoke to Elijah, commanding the prophet to anoint Hazael (HAZ ay el)
as king of Aram, Jehu as king over Israel, and Elisha as prophet in
Elijah’s place (vv. 9-18).

Getting started

**Guide: **Invite the group to turn to **page 3** of the **Personal
Study Guide** (**PSG**) and review the titles of the six sessions of
this study titled,** "Elisha: Seeing the Hand of God at Work."**

**Leader Pack:** Display **Item 8, Elisha: Seeing the Hand of God at
Work **poster to overview the study and reference session titles
throughout the study.

**Discuss: **Draw attention to the question on **PSG, page 105** and ask
**Question 1: What’s the most interesting invitation you’ve received?**

**Guide:** Refer the group to **"The Bible Meets Life"** **(PSG, page
105)** and the author’s comments about invitations. Use them to
highlight the truth that we receive numerous invitations on a regular
basis.

**Say:** While it would be unwise to accept every invitation we receive,
some we should accept without hesitation, especially those that are
given by God.

**Guide:** Introduce **The Point** on **PSG, page 105: **God invites us
to join Him in His work.

**Optional Introduction: **Refer to "Life Connection" on page 108 for an
alternate introduction to the study.

**Pray:** Begin the session with prayer. Ask God to heighten the group’s
sensitivity to His voice. Pray that each member would understand that
God calls every believer to serve by joining God in His work.

Study the Bible

1 Kings 19:19-21

19 Elijah left there and found Elisha son of Shaphat as he was plowing.
Twelve teams of oxen were in front of him, and he was with the twelfth
team. Elijah walked by him and threw his mantle over him. 20 Elisha left
the oxen, ran to follow Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father
and mother, and then I will follow you.” “Go on back,” he replied, “for
what have I done to you?” 21 So he turned back from following him, took
the team of oxen, and slaughtered them. With the oxen’s wooden yoke and
plow, he cooked the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then
he left, followed Elijah, and served him.

**Summarize:** Before reading the verses, refer to “The Setting” on page
108 to establish the context of the biblical passage.

**Read:** Enlist a volunteer to read 1 Kings 19:19-21.

**Leader Pack: **Display** Item 9:** **Map of Elisha's Ministry. **Use
this map to show the location of some of the key events in this passage.

**say:** Share this connection to The Point: At God’s direction, Elijah
anointed Elisha to serve, and Elisha left his livelihood to obediently
follow Elijah.

**Guide:** Refer the group to** PSG, page 107** and use the author’s
comments to show the three ways Elisha’s demonstrated “all-in
obedience”.

  
Elisha “left the oxen,” and “ran to follow Elijah." This shows Elisha
knew his previous vocation would now take a back seat to his call of
prophet.

  
His request to kiss my father and mother showed that he knew that God
must now be the priority in his life (contrast with Luke 9:61-62).

  
When Elisha slaughtered the oxen and fed the people, it was his way of
saying, “There’s no going back; I’m all in!”

**Summarize:** Refer to the **Bible Commentary** to provide information
to demonstrate God called Elisha, and Elisha responded positively.

****Mantle ****(v. 19).

****For what have I done to you? ****(v. 20).

****Kiss my father and mother ****(v. 20).

**Followed . . . served **(v. 21).

**Discuss:** **Question 2: What are some things we might have to leave
behind in order to join God in His work?**

**Alternate Question: **What are some obstacles that can prevent us from
responding to God’s leadership with all-in obedience?

**Transition:** Elisha understood he couldn’t fill Elijah’s shoes in his
own strength or abilities. He knew he was going to need God’s help.

1 Kings 19:19-21 Commentary

**Elijah** (v. 19) was a ninth-century prophet from Tishbe in the
Northern Kingdom of Israel (1 Kings 17:1–2 Kings 2:12). Much of his
ministry entailed his confrontations with King Ahab of Israel and Ahab’s
wife, Jezebel, because they promoted polytheism rather the worshiping
Yahweh, the one, true God. Early in his ministry, Elijah declared to
King Ahab that there would be no rain in the land apart from the
prophet’s command (1 Kings 17:1). During the drought, Elijah went to
Zarephath (*ZAR ih fath*; a town south of Sidon on the Mediterranean
seacoast), where he first miraculously provided for a widow and her son,
and then after the son’s death raised him from the dead (vv. 8-24).
Elijah is perhaps best known for God’s victory over the prophets of Baal
and Asherah at Mount Carmel (chap. 18).

**Elisha** (v. 19). Elisha’s name is a combination of the Hebrew words
for God and salvation, so his name means “My God is salvation” or “My
God saves.” Elisha is called “man of God” about thirty times in 1 and 2
Kings. That title is used for Moses as well (Deut. 33:1; Josh. 14:6).

**Mantle** (v. 19). The Hebrew term for *mantle* appears twelve times in
the Old Testament. It is associated with both a physical outer garment
(cloak or robe) and the idea of splendor and glory. The English phrase
“pass the mantle” is used today even in secular contexts for one leader
passing on leadership to his or her successor and may have originated
with this story. By placing his mantel on Elisha, Elijah was obeying
God’s command to anoint Elisha as prophet in his place (v. 16). The act
also symbolized the passing of Elijah’s prophetic power and authority to
Elisha.

**Kiss my father and mother** (v. 20). The implication of this phrase is
that Elisha was not a reluctant prophet, but he was a realistic one. He
understood the cost of discipleship, and he was returning to say goodbye
to his parents, his life, and his security. There is an echo of the call
of Abram in this text (Gen. 12:1-3), as God called both men to leave the
security of family and home and depend on the providence and power of
God.

**For what have I done to you?** (v. 20). By asking this rhetorical
question, Elijah was communicating to Elisha that the call on Elisha’s
life was not actually from Elijah. Though Elijah was acting as God’s
mouthpiece, the call on Elisha’s life was from God Himself.
Consequently, though Elisha would serve as Elijah’s attendant, Elisha’s
service was ultimately to God and not his mentor.

**The oxen’s wooden yoke and plow** (v. 21). The use of the *yoke* and
*plow* to cook the meat was an act that symbolized the clear break
Elisha was making with his former life, to which he would not be
returning. Jesus used similar imagery when He described the type of
separation from one’s former life in relation to being His disciple, “No
one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom
of God” (Luke 9:62).

**Gave it to the people** (v. 21). Elisha’s return to his home to bid
farewell to his father and mother was not merely a return to his nuclear
family. In the ancient world households included extended families as
well as those in the service of the family. In addition to any sons and
daughters, Elisha’s parents’ household would have been made up of
relatives, household servants, and close friends. By returning to his
parents’ household and sacrificing the oxen, Elisha was able to serve an
entire group of people, and they were blessed by his sacrifice. By
making this kind of sacrifice, Elisha was also communicating the joy
that he had in being called to be the Lord’s prophet.

**Followed . . . served** (v. 21). The Hebrew term for *followed *means
to walk in both a literal sense and figuratively in reference to one’s
lifestyle or pattern of conduct. The term for *served* means to minister
or attend. Elisha’s call from God was to the lifestyle of service to
Yahweh first as Elijah’s attendant and later as Elijah’s successor as a
prophet of God.

2 Kings 2:7-11

7 Fifty men from the sons of the prophets came and stood observing them
at a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan. 8 Elijah took
his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water, which parted to the
right and left. Then the two of them crossed over on dry ground. 9 When
they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I can do for
you before I am taken from you.” So Elisha answered, “Please, let me
inherit two shares of your spirit.” 10 Elijah replied, “You have asked
for something difficult. If you see me being taken from you, you will
have it. If not, you won’t.” 11 As they continued walking and talking, a
chariot of fire with horses of fire suddenly appeared and separated the
two of them. Then Elijah went up into heaven in the whirlwind.

**Read:** Enlist a volunteer to read 2 Kings 2:7-11.

**say:** Share this connection to The Point: Knowing Elijah would soon
depart, Elisha asked for the Spirit of God to be with him as He was with
Elijah.

**Digging Deeper: **See the article **A Significant Location, PSG, p.
109.**

**Recap:** Share the author's observations on **PSG, pp. 109–110** to
illustrate the wisdom of asking for God’s presence as believers serve.

God was with Elijah and Elisha knew he needed the same so he boldly
asked. When we ask for God’s presence as we serve, we discover 3
important truths:

  
God is the Master, we’re the servants. We acknowledge we’re the conduit
God works through to accomplish His purposes. His agenda is the
priority.

  
God’s presence will heighten our spiritual sensitivity. God’s presence
helps us discern the hand of God at work.

  
God doesn’t call the equipped but equips the called. God continues to
work in this way. This is what enables every believer to serve the Lord.

**Summarize:** Refer to the **Bible Commentary** to highlight these key
words from v. 7-11 to show Elisha’s request wasn’t motivated by greed or
selfishness.

****Let me inherit**** (v. 9).

**Two shares of your spirit **(v. 9).

**Discuss:** **Question 3: How has God’s presence made a difference as
you’ve served Him?**

**Alternate Question: **What might be the consequences of trying to
serve God apart from His presence?

**Transition:** God granted Elisha’s request for two shares of Elijah’s
spirit. For Elisha, there was really only one way to move forward now.

2 Kings 2:7-11 Commentary

**Context.** The time of Elijah’s departure arrived. When the Lord told
Elijah to go to first Bethel and then Jericho, both times Elijah told
Elisha to “stay here,” and both times Elisha refused to leave the
prophet. In both Bethel and Jericho “the sons of the prophets” told
Elisha that the Lord was taking Elijah away (2 Kings 2:1-5). Elijah told
Elisha that the Lord had commanded him to go to the Jordan River, and
again Elisha told Elijah that he would not leave the prophet. So the two
traveled to the Jordan (v. 6).

**The sons of the prophets **(v. 7). This phrase appears only between 1
Kings 20 and 2 Kings 9 in the Old Testament. The word *sons* does not
indicate a biological relationship, but rather some type of prophetic
group or guild. *The sons of the prophets* were under the authority of a
greater prophet of God (2 Kings 6:1).

**Struck the water** (v. 8). Elijah’s actions here echo Moses’s actions
when God parted the Red Sea (Ex. 14:21-31). In both cases, the
individual was the means God used to display His power. The staff that
Moses used and the mantle that Elijah used were not magical items with
the power to create miracles. Instead, they were symbols of the power of
God to do miraculous activity and demonstrated that as the Creator He
has power over nature.

**Let me inherit **(v. 9). This phrase speaks to the familial
relationship Elijah and Elisha shared. It also indicates that Elisha
understood that the prophetic role he would take up in Elijah’s place
was received according to God’s grace and power.

**Two shares of your spirit** (v. 9). God instructed the people of
Israel that their firstborn sons were to inherit a double portion of
their fathers’ estates (Deut. 21:17). This phrase indicates the familial
nature of the relationship between Elijah and Elisha. *Your spirit*
refers to the Spirit of God which rested on Elijah. Elisha’s reference
to *your spirit* demonstrates he understood he would be inheriting
Elijah’s responsibilities as a prophet and that such prophetic
responsibilities were a gift from God and exercised through God’s power.

**Chariot of fire with horses of fire** (v. 11). In this context, *fire*
symbolizes the presence of God. In the ancient world, the power of a
king and his kingdom was often measured by the strength of the
army—horses, chariots, and charioteers (Ex. 14:7-9; Josh. 17:16-18; 1
Sam. 13:5; 1 Kings 10:26). In a similar way, the omnipotent power of God
is demonstrated by His army of fiery horses and chariots.

> Just as the fire God sent down upon Mount Carmel demonstrated His
> omnipotent power over the false gods Baal and Asherah (1 Kings
> 18:19-40), so now in taking Elijah to heaven the Lord demonstrated His
> power over life and death. Elijah did not die, but was taken alive
> into God’s presence.

**Heaven** (v. 11). In the Old Testament, the Lord’s presence is said to
dwell in different places. The garden of Eden, the tabernacle, and the
temple were sacred spaces where God dwelt among His people. However,
throughout the Old Testament God is also said to dwell in heaven. In
fact, Deuteronomy 26:15 declares that heaven is God’s “holy dwelling.”
From heaven God rules all creation and relates to humanity, sending
blessings and passing judgments over the people who dwell on the earth.
So, when Elijah was taken up “into heaven in the whirlwind,” all those
who were watching would have understood that Elijah had entered into the
place where God’s presence dwells.

**The whirlwind** (v. 11). The false Canaanite god Baal was worshiped as
the Rider of the Clouds and was believed to have power over fertility,
the seasons, rain, and wind. By taking Elijah up to heaven in a
whirlwind, the Lord was demonstrating, as He had done both through the
drought (1 Kings 17:1; 18:1) and at Mount Carmel (18:19-40), that He
alone is Lord over creation and is the one true God.

2 Kings 2:12-15

12 As Elisha watched, he kept crying out, “My father, my father, the
chariots and horsemen of Israel!” When he could see him no longer, he
took hold of his own clothes, tore them in two, 13 picked up the mantle
that had fallen off Elijah, and went back and stood on the bank of the
Jordan. 14 He took the mantle Elijah had dropped, and he struck the
water. “Where is the Lord God of Elijah? ” he asked. He struck the water
himself, and it parted to the right and the left, and Elisha crossed
over. 15 When the sons of the prophets from Jericho who were observing
saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to
meet him and bowed down to the ground in front of him.

**Read:** Enlist a volunteer to read 2 Kings 2:12-15.

**say:** Share this connection to The Point: Rely on God’s power to do
His work.

**Recap: **Refer to **PSG, p. 111** to the author’s comments that God
gave Elisha three signs that reassured Elisha to rely on God and His
power.

****Elisha’s request for two shares of Elijah’s spirit.**** This
emphatically told Elisha his request for God’s spirit to accompany him
had been granted.

****Elijah’s mantle.**** God used Elijah's mantle to tell Elisha, “I
have chosen you to succeed Elijah. You can do it because my Spirit will
be with you.”

**The parting of the Jordan river.** Elisha did what every good disciple
does: he imitated his mentor. It was the moment of truth.

**Say:** Could Elisha rely upon God and His power just like Elijah did?
God emphatically said “Yes!” when the Jordan parted to the right and the
left.

**Discuss: Question 4: How have you experienced God’s empowerment as you
serve Him?**

**Summarize:** Refer to the **Bible Commentary** to point out the
following terms to demonstrate that Elisha was now God’s prophet to the
people.

****Picked up the mantle ****(v. 13).

****The spirit of Elijah ****(v. 15).

**Bowed down **(v. 15).

**Discuss:** **Question 5: How does God empower believers today to do
His work?**

**Alternate Question: **What steps can we take to rely on God’s power as
we seek to serve Him today?

**Engage:** Invite the group to complete the Engage activity **(PSG, p.
112).**

to illustrate how we survive by power supplied for us.

2 Kings 2:12-15 Commentary

**My father** (v. 12). Elisha had a familial relationship with Elijah,
viewing him as a spiritual father. A similar relationship existed
between Elijah/Elisha and the sons of the prophets (vv. 3,5). This
perspective echoes the relationship Jesus has with believers, “Here are
my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God is my brother
and sister and mother” (Mark 3:34-35).

**The chariots and horsemen of Israel** (v. 12). The *chariots* and
*horsemen* of fire represent God’s presence and strength. That Elisha
identified them with Israel indicates both that God is Israel’s true
strength and that the power behind Elijah’s ministry was God. Now God
was taking Elijah up into heaven. This is another indication that God is
greater than the false Canaanite god Baal. The Lord has power over both
storms (Baal was said to be the storm god) and over life and death. The
God of Israel is not merely some regional god whose power is limited to
a geographic area or a certain group of people. He is Lord over all
creation and all peoples. He alone deserves our worship. He calls all
people to repent and place their faith in Jesus Christ; when they do
this, they will find abundant and eternal life.

**Tore them** (v. 12). Throughout Scripture, the tearing of one’s
clothes signifies mourning and grief. When Elijah proclaimed God’s
judgment upon King Ahab of Israel for all his evil and idolatry, Ahab
tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and fasted in grief and repentance
(1 Kings 21:17-27). When Job was informed he lost everything and his
children had been killed he tore his robe and shaved his head (Job
1:13-20). The tearing of one’s clothes was also a reaction to situations
which were considered to be blasphemous. At Jesus’s hearing before the
Sanhedrin, the Jewish high priest tore his robes when he believed
Jesus’s claim to be the Messiah was blasphemy (Matt. 26:63-65). Paul and
Barnabas tore their clothes when the people of Lystra tried to worship
them (Acts 14:11-15).

**Picked up the mantle** (v. 13). By picking up Elijah’s *mantle,*
Elisha picked up not only Elijah’s physical clothes but also took on
Elijah’s spiritual role as God’s prophet.

**Where is the Lord God of Elijah?** (v. 14). Elisha did not ask this
question from a position of doubt but from a position of boldness and
belief. He knew that he was the successor to Elijah. Elisha was
entreating God to display His power through him in the same way that He
had displayed that power through Elijah.

**The spirit of Elijah** (v. 15). The sons of the prophets recognized
that the Spirit who had rested on Elijah now rested on Elisha. As such,
the power of God that Elijah had access to was now available to Elisha.
While that power would be made manifest in miraculous acts such as the
parting of water and later in raising the dead, the most miraculous act
that Elisha would perform was to speak the words of God. The one thing
that people need more than anything else is the Word of God being spoken
to them in such a way that they can hear, understand, and respond in
faith to the Creator God who loves them and desires to have a
relationship with them (John 1:10-13; 3:16-18; Heb. 3:15).

**Bowed down** (v. 15). The action of bowing down indicates submission
to authority. By bowing down before Elisha, the sons of the prophets
submitted themselves to Elisha’s authority and affirmed what God had
already done—made Elisha His prophet in place of Elijah. There
apparently was some lingering doubt among the sons of the prophets as to
whether Elisha was God’s prophet in Elijah’s place. Believing the Lord
might have moved Elijah to another earthly location, they persistently
asked Elisha that some of them might go in search of Elijah. Elisha
finally relented and after their search they returned to report they had
not found Elijah (2 Kings 2:16-18) When the church at Antioch
commissioned Barnabas and Saul as missionaries, they were recognizing
that the Holy Spirit had set apart and empowered the two for the task
(Acts 13:1-3).

Bonus Content (Optional)

**Optional Activity:** Ask the group, “What are some of the challenges
we face when our homes lose power?” Record on the left side of a white
board their responses. Then ask, “What do we do to overcome these
challenges?” and record their responses on the right side of the board.

Say, “These workarounds are good temporarily but we would rather rely on
the electricity supplied by the power company. Likewise, we can try to
accomplish God’s work through our own strength or resources but the best
way is to simply rely on His power.”
