God’s Hand in Meeting  
Our Needs

The Point

God provides for our needs.

The Passage

2 Kings 4:1-7

The Bible Meets Life

Floyd told our small group he had been sensing God was calling him into
full-time Christian ministry. The next step would be going to a
theological seminary for training. There was just one problem: Six
months earlier he had made a commitment to his parents to take a lead
role in the family business. Going to seminary would leave his parents
in a bind. We asked what he planned to do. He said he had prayed about
it and then said, “I just found out my older sister and her husband are
moving back home to start working in the family business.” I said,
“Great! When do you start seminary?” He replied, “Well, I’m still not
sure if God is calling me into ministry.”

Floyd had a real need in his life and God provided a solution, but he
was having trouble seeing it. We need God’s help, especially in times of
uncertainty or distress. The question isn’t, “Will God respond?” More
often the question is, “Will we respond to God’s help in faith and
obedience?” Today’s session will encourage us to do just that.

**1 One of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha,
“Your servant, my husband, has died. You know that your servant feared
the Lord. Now the creditor is coming to take my two children as his
slaves.” 2 Elisha asked her, “What can I do for you? Tell me, what do
you have in the house?” She said, “Your servant has nothing in the house
except a jar of oil.”**

**2 Kings 4:1-2 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **A woman made her need known to God’s
prophet.

**The sons of the prophets** **(v. 1).** *Sons* does not indicate a
biological relationship to the prophets, but rather membership in a
class or group. *The sons of the prophets* indicates a community or
guild of prophets. When Elijah was taken into heaven and Elisha
performed miracles, the sons of the prophets bowed before Elisha
recognizing that Elisha’s power was the same power Elijah had possessed
(2:15-18). Later events (4:38-41; 6:1-7) indicate Elisha’s role as
supervisor over the sons of the prophets.

**A widow’s situation** **(v. 1). **The woman who cried out to Elisha
was a widow of one of the sons of the prophets. In biblical times,
widows were in a very vulnerable position. They often lacked economic,
legal, and physical means of support and could be easily taken advantage
of. In this instance, the widow possessed only a jar of oil, and a
creditor was approaching to take her children as slaves as payment for
her debt. The prophet Elijah dealt with a similar situation involving a
widow (1 Kings 17:8-24). The vulnerability of widows led to the early
church designating certain men to oversee both Greek and Jewish widows
so the daily needs of all the widows would be met (Acts 6:1-6; on the
early church’s emphasis on the care of widows and orphans see Jas.
1:27).

**“Your servant” (v. 1).** The term *servant* can refer to one who
serves God, kings, rulers, as well as anyone who serves a superior. The
word was also commonly used as a term for polite address among equals or
in relation to one who was superior in rank. Most likely the woman was
using the term as an expression of humility toward Elisha. The phrase
would also have been appropriate since her husband had been one of the
sons of the prophets; Elisha as leader of the group would have been her
husband’s superior. That the widow was one of the wives of the sons of
the prophets indicates that the sons of the prophets were permitted to
marry.

**“Feared the Lord” (v. 1).** Proverbs 1:7 says, “The fear of the Lord
is the beginning of knowledge.” When confronted with God’s power,
beauty, majesty, and glory the only appropriate response is one of awe
that leads to love for and obedience to Him. By mentioning that her dead
husband had feared the Lord, the widow was communicating to Elisha that
he had been a man who loved and served God with his heart, soul, mind,
and strength (see Deut. 6:4-6; Mark 12:28-30). Lord is a substitution
for God’s covenant name Yahweh, which was viewed as being too holy to
speak lest it be mispronounced. Yahweh emphasizes God’s eternal
self-existence and His self-sufficiency. It is also the title by which
God as Creator and Redeemer called the Israelites into relationship with
Him (Ex. 3:13-15).

**“The creditor”** **(v. 1).** In the ancient Near East, the practice of
enslaving a person’s wife and/or children as a form of debt payment was
common. The person receiving the loan made a pledge in the form of
property as collateral on the loan, sometimes pledging himself and/or
members of his family against the loan. However, God gave the laws found
in the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament) and
especially Deuteronomy 15:1-18 as instructions for the care of the poor
and vulnerable among His people; especially those indebted and enslaved.
While in Israelite society everyone was responsible for looking out for
the poor and vulnerable, it was particularly the role of a family member
(known as the kinsman redeemer) to deliver his relatives from
indebtedness and slavery (Lev. 25:47-55). The Hebrew prophets condemned
the rich for their abuse of the poor and helpless of society and called
on God’s people to care for them (Isa. 3:14-15; 58:6-10; Ezek. 22:29;
Jer. 5:28; 22:3; Amos 2:6-7; 4:1; Zech. 7:10; Mal. 3:5). That this widow
had fallen into such a desperate situation indicates that God’s
instructions and provisions for the poor had been either forgotten or
ignored. However, through God’s power, Elisha would take on the role of
this widow’s redeemer.

**“A jar of oil”** **(v. 2).** The term for *jar* is used only here in
the Hebrew Old Testament. It was most likely a small container. Some
suggest in this instance that it was not the standard type of jar used
for storing oil in a home, but rather a small bottle or flask used for
anointing. This would have further emphasized the destitute state of the
widow and her children.

**2 Kings 4:3-4**

**3 Then he said, “Go out and borrow empty containers from all your
neighbors. Do not get just a few. 4 Then go in and shut the door behind
you and your sons, and pour oil into all these containers. Set the full
ones to one side.”**

> ACTIVITY (OPTIONAL): Use the **“Oil”** option (page 125 of this Leader

**2 Kings 4:3-4 **Commentary

**Connection to the Point.** Elisha directed the woman to collect jars
to be prepared for how God would provide.

**“Borrow”** **(v. 3). **The Hebrew term for *borrow* in this context
means to ask as a favor for temporary use. The term is also used later
in the Elisha account of the axe head used by one of the sons of the
prophets that fell into the water while he was chopping down a tree. The
man cried out, “Oh, my master, it *was* *borrowed*!” (2 Kings 6:5,
emphasis added). The term is also used in the sense of to consult or
inquire of either God (“seek,” Josh. 9:14) or of a person such as a
child asking a question of his or her father (“ask,” 4:21). The word
could also be used to inquire if someone was well (Gen. 43:27; Jer.
15:5), much as the modern-day question, “How are you doing?”

**“Empty Containers”** **(v. 3).** Storage containers were typically
tall oval or pear-shaped jars about twenty-five inches in height and
sixteen inches in diameter, having two or four handles. The bases were
usually rounded, coming to a point. They were placed in stands, in the
holes of wood planks, or pressed into the ground.

The Hebrew term for *containers* has a wide range of meaning. It was the
general term for a vessel, object, or utensil. More specifically, it
could refer to bags, vessels, or containers (1 Sam. 17:49; 1 Kings
17:10), weapons and armor (1 Sam. 14:13; 2 Kings 11:11), musical
instruments (1 Chron. 15:16; 16:42), tools for working (1 King 6:7), a
yoke for animals such as oxen (2 Sam. 24:22), for furniture/furnishings
(Ex. 31:7; 39:33), for jewelry (Ex. 3:22), and even for boats made out
of papyrus reeds. In this instance, identifying the borrowed vessels as
empty containers emphasizes that they were commonplace every-day vessels
that God would use to perform a miracle. The focus is on God, not the
vessels themselves.

The apostle Paul wrote, “Now we have this treasure in clay jars, so that
this extraordinary power may be from God and not from us” (2 Cor. 4:7).
While he did not indicate what this treasure is, most likely it refers
to the gospel. Clay jars were both ordinary and fragile. As believers,
we are the conduits God uses to proclaim the message of salvation
through Jesus Christ. We should be humbled when we are compared to
ordinary jars; there is nothing about us that deserves to be used by
God. However, we should be encouraged and emboldened to action because
God accomplishes His purposes through ordinary, everyday people like us.

**“Do not get just a few”** **(v. 3).** Elisha was expecting God to do
great things, so he instructed the widow to get more than just a few
containers. The miracle God would perform for the widow was greater than
the small container of oil she possessed (v. 2). The prophet wanted the
widow to see that God could do great things in her life. God’s miracle
was going to be extravagant.

All our efforts for the kingdom will only be effective inasmuch as we
are dependent and expectant that God can and will do great things. We
can and should trust that God “is able to do above and beyond all that
we ask or think according to the power that works in us” (Eph. 3:20).
This is the very nature of faith itself—which has God as its object. We
trust what God has already done through Jesus Christ to redeem us, and
we step out in faith trusting and having an expectant hope for what God
has promised to do for us and through us in the future.

**“Oil”** **(v. 4)** was a major component of life in ancient Israel.
The most common oil was made from olives, due to the abundance of olive
trees in Israel. The oil was extracted from olives using an olive press.
Olive oil was used in food preparation and was an essential part of
people’s diets. It was also used as fuel for lamps (Ex. 25:6; Matt.
25:3), as medicine in treating wounds (Isa. 1:6; Luke 10:34), as a
cosmetic for perfume and skin care (Ruth 3:3), and in religious
ceremonies, such as anointing kings (1 Sam. 10:1), priests (Lev. 8:30),
objects such as altars (Lev. 8:11), markers/pillars (Gen. 35:14), and
the tabernacle and its furnishings (Ex. 40:9-11; Lev. 8:10). Because of
the many uses of oil in daily life, it was also an important commodity
of trade. As such, it was a resource the widow could sell both to pay
her families’ debt and have money on which to live (2 Kings 4:7).

**2 Kings 4:5-7**

**5 So she left. After she had shut the door behind her and her sons,
they kept bringing her containers, and she kept pouring. 6 When they
were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.” But he
replied, “There aren’t any more.” Then the oil stopped. 7 She went and
told the man of God, and he said, “Go sell the oil and pay your debt;
you and your sons can live on the rest.”**

**2 Kings 4:5-7 **Commentary

**Connection to the Point.** God miraculously filled every jar with oil.

**Parallels to Elijah’s miracle.** The mention of the jar of oil should
cause readers to remember how God had provided for the widow in Elijah’s
ministry (1 Kings 17:8-16) and create an expectation that God was going
to perform a similar miracle in this situation. In both cases, the Lord
provided for a person whom society had cast aside. The Lord used
ordinary, everyday products that were essential to life and their
containers to perform the miracles.

The miracles of Elijah and Elisha have both similarities and
differences. Whereas Elijah performed the miracle at Zarephath near
Sidon (north of Israel in Phoenicia, 1 Kings 17:9), the miracle of
Elisha apparently took place in Israel. Both widows were in a state of
desperate need. Elijah’s widow was facing starvation (1 Kings 17:10-12),
whereas Elisha’s widow was facing both poverty and the loss of her
children to a creditor (2 Kings 4:1-2). Elijah’s miracle focused on a
flour jar and an oil jug which remained full until the drought the land
was experiencing was over (1 Kings 17:14-16), whereas Elisha’s miracle
used a hands-on approach. The prophet commanded the widow and her sons
to gather many empty containers and pour oil from her jar into the empty
containers. Oil flowed out of the single jar into the containers until
no empty containers remained (2 Kings 4:3-6). Both miracles supplied
food for the widows and their families. However, whereas the widow in
Elijah’s case was provided with flour and oil to make food, in Elisha’s
miracle he commanded the widow to sell the oil to pay off her creditor
and provide for her family (1 Kings 17:16; 2 Kings 4:7).

**“Shut the door”** **(v. 5).** This entire event in which God
miraculously provided a massive amount of oil for the widow took place
in secret—behind a closed door. The widow’s neighbors had provided the
containers, but they did not see what happened as her little vessel of
oil continued to fill container after container. That the miracle took
place in secret at the hands of the widow and not in the presence of the
prophet Elisha emphasizes that it was God and His power that were the
source of the miracle, as well as demonstrating His care and mercy
toward the widow and her sons.

Scripture often encourages us to share publicly how God has provided for
us, and there are times we should declare that the Lord has done great
things for us. Psalm 126 and other passages like it testify that the
nations will be drawn to God because of the great things that He does
for and through His people. Jesus commanded His disciples, “You are the
light of the world. A city situated on a hill cannot be hidden. No one
lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but rather on a lampstand, and
it gives light for all who are in the house. In the same way, let your
light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give
glory to your Father in heaven” (Matt. 5:14-16). However, this session
passage indicates that there are also times when God’s blessings on our
lives can and should remain a private matter—just between us and God.
Regarding both giving to the poor and prayer (6:1-6), Jesus commanded
that these actions be done in secret and “your Father who sees in secret
will reward you” (vv. 3-4,6).

**“Pay”** **(v. 7). **The Hebrew term has the meaning of to complete or
finish. It can mean to make good (in the sense of paying one’s debts),
as well as to make whole or good (in the sense of restoration). The
Hebrew word contains the same consonants as and is related to the term
*shalom*. *Shalom* is often translated “peace”; however, it carries a
wider range of meaning than simply the absence of conflict. The Hebrew
concept of *shalom* is a picture of wholeness and completeness. The
widow was not only able to pay her existing debt; she and her sons were
able to live on the rest. God met the widow’s immediate need and
provided for the daily needs of her family as well.

God’s provision in the life of this widow foreshadows God’s provision
through the atoning work of Christ available to all who will repent and
place their faith in Jesus as Savior and Lord. The initial moment of
justification (when all the believer’s sins are forgiven, he or she is
reconciled to God, and permanently receives the perfect righteousness of
Christ) is followed by the ongoing process of sanctification (the
life-long process of being transformed into the image of Christ in one’s
character and behavior).
