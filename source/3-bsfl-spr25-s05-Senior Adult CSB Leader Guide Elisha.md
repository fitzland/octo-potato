Session 5

God’s Hand in Facing Opposition

The Point

God is more powerful than those who oppose us.

Life Connection

The world is at war and every human being is involved in the conflict.
But this is not a war of country against country; it is a spiritual
battle. As believers, we often don’t think in these terms; however, only
by realizing we are in this fight can we stand in Christ against Satan
and his wiles. Thankfully, we don’t stand alone. God Himself stands with
us whenever we face opposition.

The Passage

2 Kings 6:8-12,15-23

The Setting

In this session, 2 Kings 6:8-12,15-23 records another miraculous event
that confirms the kindness and sympathy of Elisha in his calling as a
man of God. Under the power of God, he worked miracles that addressed
human need and honored the Lord God of Israel.

> In this session we will find assurance that God is more powerful than
> those who oppose us. First, God knows what we are facing. Nothing is
> beyond His knowledge. He opens our eyes to see His presence,
> protection, and work on our behalf. Finally, as the Lord has been

Getting started

**Discuss: **Draw attention to the question on **PSG, page 149** and ask
**Question 1: What did a schoolyard altercation look like when you were
a child?**

**Guide:** Refer the group to **"The Bible Meets Life"** **(PSG, page
149)** and use the author’s story about his friend Doyle and a potential
conflict to demonstrate the importance of outside help when we face
opposition.

**Say:** The Bible gives us clear teachings regarding opposition
believers face. It’s often referred to as spiritual warfare. Every
believer engages in some level of spiritual warfare against Satan and
his schemes. Thankfully, we don’t stand alone. God Himself stands with
us whenever we face opposition.

**Guide:** Introduce **The Point** on **PSG, page 149: God is more
powerful than those who oppose us.**

**Optional Introduction: **Refer to "Life Connection" on page 152 for an
alternate introduction to the study.

**Pray:** Begin the session with prayer. Ask God to guide the group to
trust in Him during times of opposition. Pray that God’s word will guide
each member to respond to opposition in Christ-like ways.

2 Kings 6:8-12

8 When the king of Aram was waging war against Israel, he conferred with
his servants, “My camp will be at such and such a place.”  
9 But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Be careful
passing by this place, for the Arameans are going down there.”
10 Consequently, the king of Israel sent word to the place the man of
God had told him about. The man of God repeatedly warned the king, so
the king would be on his guard. 11 The king of Aram was enraged because
of this matter, and he called his servants and demanded of them, “Tell
me, which one of us is for the king of Israel?” 12 One of his servants
said, “No one, my lord the king. Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells
the king of Israel even the words you speak in your bedroom.”

**Recap:** Share the author's observations on **PSG, pp. 151–152** to
highlight the author’s list of information we possess about opposition
and the enemy.

Regarding the Enemy, Satan, we are told that he is a liar and the father
of lies (John 8:44; also see Eph. 6:11, James 4:7, Rev. 20:10).

Regarding trials and tribulations, the Bible tells us that God knows how
to rescue us from trials (2 Peter 2:9; also see Acts 20:19, James
1:2-4).

Regarding temptation, God tells us that temptation can be caused by our
own evil desires (James 1:14; also see Matt. 4:1, 1 Cor. 10:13).

Regarding sin, God tells us that we are all sinners, Romans 3:23. He
also tells us that sin leads to death (Rom. 6:23; also see Rom. 6:12, 1
John 1:9).

2 Kings 6:8-12 Commentary

**King of Aram** (v. 8). Whereas previously the king of Israel had
mistakenly feared the king of Aram (Syria) was trying to goad him into a
conflict (5:7), now the two nations were at war. It is probable that at
this time Aram’s military was stronger than that of Israel. This was
suggested earlier when the king of Israel had thought the king of Aram
was trying to pick a fight with him by requesting he heal the Aramean
Naaman’s skin disease; the Israelite king tore his clothes, an
expression of grief and mourning, acknowledging that his kingdom could
not win against the might of the Arameans.

> In both instances, neither the king of Aram nor the king of Israel
> understood the nature and power of God. While that is not surprising
> for a pagan king, what is shocking is the king of Israel’s lack of
> understanding. His role was to lead God’s people in living in a
> covenant relationship with Yahweh, the God of Israel. Instead, he
> viewed life from merely an earthly, human perspective.

**Waging war** (v. 8). King David had successfully defeated and occupied
Aram (2 Sam. 8:5-6; 10:6-19), but during the time of King Solomon the
Arameans waged war against Israel (1 Kings 11:25). Then when Israel
split into the Northern Kingdom of Israel (Samaria) and the Southern
Kingdom of Judah after Solomon’s death, the Arameans took advantage of
the weaknesses that came with the nation’s division. The relationship
between Aram and the two kingdoms would continue—sometimes as enemies,
sometimes as allies—until the Assyrians conquered Aram and deported the
Arameans in 732 BC. It has been suggested by Bible students that the
type of warfare referenced here are raids and ambushes by the Arameans.

> The true strength of the Israelites was not their army, but rather
> their God. In a somewhat amusing scenario, every time the king of Aram
> made a military decision related to the conflict with the kingdom of
> Israel, God revealed the king’s plans to the prophet Elijah who then
> warned the king of Israel. As a result, Israel’s army was able to
> evade the Aramean army’s attempted ambushes. So, while the two
> countries were at war, very little actual fighting was taking place.

**Enraged **(v. 11). The king of Aram became enraged, believing one of
his servants was revealing his plans to the king of Israel. The literal
meaning of the Hebrew term refers to a great wind or a violent storm. In
much the same way that hurricane winds rage, the king of Aram got
stirred up because he believed one of his servants was betraying him.

**My lord** (v. 12). The Hebrew word for the covenant name of God,
Yahweh, is indicated in the Old Testament by the word “Lord.” In this
instance, the word translated “lord” does not refer to God. The servant
in this verse was identifying the Aramean king as his master or ruler,
recognizing his authority over the servant.

**Your bedroom** (v. 12). The servant explained that none of the king’s
people were betraying him. Rather it was the prophet Elisha who knew all
the king’s plans, even the most private conversations the king had in
his most intimate space, his bedroom. Elisha’s knowledge about all the
king of Aram’s plans was not due to human informants or double agents
embedded among the Arameans. Rather, Elisha had access to the king of
Aram’s plans through supernatural means. Yahweh, the God of Israel, was
revealing those plans to the prophet who then related them to the king
of Israel.

2 Kings 6:15-17

15 When the servant of the man of God got up early and went out,
he discovered an army with horses and chariots surrounding the city. So
he asked Elisha, “Oh, my master, what are we to do?”  
16 Elisha said, “Don’t be afraid, for those who are with us outnumber
those who are with them.” 17 Then Elisha prayed, “Lord, please open his
eyes and let him see.” So the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he saw
that the mountain was covered with horses and chariots of fire all
around Elisha.

His work.

**Recap:** Share the author's personal stories on **PSG, p. 153** to
undergird the truth that God opens our eyes to see His work.

One of the crucial steps of maturation for the believer is developing
the ability to see God’s hand at work in our lives. Sometimes we see
God’s hand at work simply through the way He leads us to serve Him and
others.

We can also see God’s hand at work when He stands with us during
opposition, especially when dealing with temptation.

which tells us, “The one who is in you is greater than the one who is in
the world.”

warfare.

2 Kings 6:15-17 Commentary

**Context.** Knowing that Elisha was thwarting his battle plans, the
king of Aram sought to capture the prophet. He received intelligence
that Elisha was in Dothan, so the king dispatched a massive army by
night to seize the prophet. The scene is somewhat humorous and ironic.
Since God had revealed all the previous plans of the king of Aram to
Elisha, what made the Aramean king think his plan to capture the prophet
would escape God’s notice this time?

> The king of Aram did not understand who he was dealing with—he did not
> understand the nature of Almighty God. The false gods he worshiped
> were merely idols, blocks of stone and wood. They were powerless. In
> contrast, the one true God is omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient
> (all knowing), and omnipresent (He is capable of being present
> everywhere at once). Nothing escapes His notice. Therefore, the king
> of Aram’s plan to capture Elisha was doomed from the start. The king’s
> futile attempt to silence Elisha is reminiscent of attempts that were
> made to capture or kill the prophet Elijah (1 Kings 19:1-2; 2 Kings
> 1:9-15).

**The servant of the man of God** (v. 15). In this instance, the name of
the servant of Elisha is not given.

**Those who are with us** (v. 16). While human beings usually view life
in this world from a physical perspective, there is also a spiritual
realm which is just as real and is populated by spiritual beings both
good and evil. Just as human armies battle in the physical world,
spiritual armies wage war in this other realm. For example, when the
prophet Daniel prayed seeking to understand a revelation he had received
from God, an angel was dispatched to explain the meaning of the
revelation to the prophet. However, the angel was hindered for
twenty-one days by an evil spiritual being identified as “the prince of
the kingdom of Persia.” It was only after the angel Michael came to
assist the messenger angel that he was able to fulfill his mission to
Daniel. The messenger also told Daniel that when the angel left, the
battle would continue as “the prince of Greece” would join the prince of
Persia against the messenger angel and Michael (Dan. 10:10-21). Another
reference to this spiritual realm is made by Jesus in the garden of
Gethsemane; He spoke of how if He asked, God the Father would put twelve
legions of angels (seventy-two thousand) at His disposal (Matt. 26:53).

**Open his eyes** (v. 17). Elisha’s request did not refer to his
servant’s physical eyes; his servant was not blind in the sense of not
being able to see the physical world around him. Instead, Elisha asked
God to give his servant spiritual eyes to see the true reality of their
situation. The servant’s “natural” reaction was to panic at the sight of
the massive Aramean army that surrounded Dothan. But Elisha, the prophet
of God, recognized that the omnipotent power of God was with him to
protect him and his servant.

**Horses and chariots of fire** (v. 17). These words identify the forces
sent by God to protect Elisha. They are a contrast to the relatively
feeble power of the king of Aram, who sent “horses, chariots, and a
massive army” to seize Elisha (v. 14). These horses and chariots of fire
recall the means by which the prophet Elijah had been taken up into
heaven in a whirlwind (2:11-12). Fire in both instances indicates the
presence of God.

2 Kings 6:18-23

18 When the Arameans came against him, Elisha prayed to the Lord,
“Please strike this nation with blindness.” So he struck them with
blindness, according to Elisha’s word. 19 Then Elisha said to them,
“This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will
take you to the man you’re looking for.” And he led them to Samaria. 20
When they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “Lord, open these men’s eyes and
let them see.” So the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw that they
were in the middle of Samaria. 21 When the king of Israel saw them, he
said to Elisha, “Should I kill them, should I kill them, my father?” 22
Elisha replied, “Don’t kill them. Do you kill those you have captured
with your sword or your bow? Set food and water in front of them so they
can eat and drink and go to their master.” 23 So he prepared a big feast
for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they
went to their master. The Aramean raiders did not come into Israel’s
land again.

*****Firepower—*****Our strength to engage in spiritual warfare is God’s
vast strength and power; not our own strength.

*****  
Defense—*****Our tactical defense equipment is God’s armor which
consists of truth, righteousness, readiness, faith, and salvation.

  
*****Offense—*****Our offensive weapons are the word of God and prayer.

  
*****Enemy—*****Our enemy is not people; we engage in spiritual warfare
“against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers
of this darkness, against evil, spiritual forces in the heavens” (Eph.
6:12).

*****  
Victory—*****Our victory isn’t defeating or discrediting the people who
oppose us; our victory is to stand our ground, to continue to affirm the
truth of the gospel and the reality of God’s presence in the world
today.

2 Kings 6:18-23 Commentary

**Strike this nation with blindness** (v. 18). Elisha now addressed the
Aramean army surrounding them. While Elisha and his servant were
protected by God’s horses and chariots of fire, Elisha went a step
further in order to protect the Israelites, asking God to strike the
Aramean army with blindness. God granted Elisha’s prayer, and the
Aramean army was rendered blind.

**The man you’re looking for** (v. 19). The Aramean soldiers were sent
by their king to go to Dothan to look for the troublemaker Elisha and to
capture him. Ironically, the man speaking to them and “helping” them was
the very man whom they were looking for! Yet, their blindness left them
unable to recognize the man that they were seeking was in front of them.
Instead of capturing Elisha, they were in effect his captives. Whereas
they had laid siege in Dothan around the prophet, now the man they were
seeking guided them into the presence of the king of Israel where the
Arameans were at the king’s mercy.

**Entered Samaria** (v. 20). Sometime after Israel split into two
nations with the death of King Solomon, Samaria became the capital of
the Northern Kingdom of Israel (Samaria). It was located in the central
highlands, about forty-two miles north of Jerusalem. King Omri, the
kingdom’s sixth ruler (reigned 885–874 BC), purchased the hill of
Samaria for his residence and relocated the capital of the Northern
Kingdom to Samaria. The city’s location on a hill provided a significant
military advantage. The Syrians twice laid siege to the city but were
unsuccessful in their attempts to capture it (1 Kings 20; 2 Kings 6).
The city eventually fell to the Assyrians after a three-year siege (2
Kings 17:5; 18:9-12).

**King of Israel** (v. 21). The text does not name the specific king of
Israel involved in these events. The account does not portray him as a
godly king and makes clear that it was not his leadership that saved the
people of Israel. Instead, it was God through His power and His prophet
Elisha who saved both the king and the people of Israel from the army of
Aram.

**My father** (v. 21). While the king of Israel was the leader of his
people, in this instance he recognized Elisha, the prophet of God, as
being his spiritual superior. The king looked to Elisha for permission
to do what he desired—to kill the captive Aramean soldiers who were at
his mercy. Instead of giving the king permission to kill the Aramean
soldiers, Elisha reasoned with the king that if these soldiers had been
taken captive in battle, the king would not have killed them. They would
have been taken as the spoils of war and enslaved.

**A big feast** (v. 23). Instead of endorsing the king’s plan, Elisha
instructed the king that he should give the Arameans food and water and
let the soldiers return to their master, the king of Aram (see Prov.
25:21-22; Rom. 12:20-21). The Israelite king wanted to give the Aramean
soldiers judgment and death, which would have been the expected
response. However, Elisha told the king to offer them mercy and grace.
Mercy is not receiving the punishment deserved. Grace is being given
benefits which are undeserved. Instead of death, the Arameans were
treated to a great feast.

> We all deserve God’s judgment for our sinfulness. But the ultimate
> demonstration of grace and mercy is found in what God has done for us
> through His Messiah, Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul taught that the
> payment we deserve for our sins is death, but the gift that we receive
> through Jesus Christ from God is forgiveness and eternal life (Rom.
> 6:23). God demonstrated His love for us in sending His Son to suffer
> the punishment we justly deserved for our sins. When we put our faith
> in Jesus, we are not simply forgiven of our sins; we are reconciled to
> God (2 Cor. 5:17-20) and adopted into His family (John 1:12-13; Rom.
> 8:12-17). We are not only removed from the domain of darkness; we are
> transferred into the kingdom of His Son (Col. 1:13-14).

Live It Out

**Review: Live It Out (PSG, page 157).** Encourage the group to follow
through this week with at least one of the applications.

Every believer faces spiritual battles, but our fight looks different
than typical warfare. Use the suggestions below to fight the opposition
you are facing in ways pleasing to the Lord.

  
*****Request.***** Pray and ask God to give you insight to the
opposition you are facing. Nothing is beyond His knowledge. Seek His
viewpoint and understanding.

  
*****Recognize.***** Study what God’s Word says about God’s protection.
Commit a passage to memory. Recognize God’s constant presence with you.

  
*****Reconcile.***** Speak words of forgiveness and compassion to those
who oppose you. Be merciful to them by setting aside the desire to
blame. Make reconciliation the goal.

Wrap It Up

**guide:** Emphasize **The Point: God is more powerful than those who
oppose us.**

**Guide:** Remind the group that God knows when we are facing opposition
and He is prepared to respond. Reaffirm that believers must have a
different view of victory when engaged in spiritual battles.

**Pray:** Lord, You are Almighty God, more powerful than any opponent we
might face. Give us courage to trust in You during times of opposition.
Remind us that our enemy is not a person or a people. Help us to season
our response to opposition with grace and mercy, and seek reconciliation
above all.

Engage

This session encourages us to be kind and gracious to those who oppose
us. Spiritual opposition isn’t simply experiencing ill treatment from
someone: it’s opposition that can prevent believers from being faithful
in their walk with Christ. Most likely there is someone in your life
that fits that description. List three ways you will be kind and
gracious toward that person.

**Optional Activity:** Say, "God opens our eyes to see His work." Google
“night vision goggles” and find a video that compares night vision with
the naked eye. Play the video and then discuss ways God helps us see our
circumstances from a spiritual perspective (If possible, a better option
would be to bring night vision goggles or a night vision scope and let
members try them out).
