Session 4

**God’s Hand in Restoring Lives**

The Point

God restores us as we are obedient to Him.

The Passage

2 Kings 5:1-3,10-19a

Life Connection

There’s no limit to what God can do! The truth of that statement might
make us think of the most grand and glorious things He has done, such as
the creation of the universe and the resurrection of Christ. God also
works through what the world might consider the smallest and least
significant things. God works as we trust and obey Him.

Background

Between verses 3 and 10, Naaman responded positively to the young
servant’s information by informing the king of Aram “what the girl from
the land of Israel had said” (v. 4). As a result, the king of Aram
ordered Naaman to go to Samaria with a letter to the king of Israel,
along with 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold, and ten sets of
clothing. The king of Aram was fully invested in seeing the commander of
his army healed. The letter was extremely brief, simply saying that the
Aramean king had sent his servant Naaman for the Israelite king to cure
him of his skin disease (v. 6).

Upon receiving the letter, the king of Israel assumed that the Aramean
king was trying to start a war with him, since he had no ability to cure
a skin disease. The king of Israel tore his clothes in a sign of grief
and mourning. This response most likely reflects that Israel was weaker
than Aram and would have lost a war with the Arameans.

Upon hearing of the Israelite king’s response, the prophet Elisha sent a
message to the Israelite king that he was to send Naaman to the prophet.
Elisha had confidence that God would heal Naaman and therefore Naaman
(and the Arameans) would know that “there is a prophet in Israel” (v.
8), which was the same as stating God is in Israel. The miracle would
demonstrate to the Arameans that the Lord, the one true God, is more
powerful than anything—including Naaman’s skin disease.

Getting started

Discuss: Give your group an opportunity to discuss **Question \#1 **on
page 125 of the Daily Discipleship Guide (DDG): **Who’s the most
prideful character you recall from a book or movie?**

Recap (DDG, page 126): Invite a volunteer to read **The Bible Meets
Life** to introduce the session:

In the film *Iron Man*, Tony Stark is a billionaire industrialist and
inventor conducting weapons tests overseas. Terrorists kidnap him to
force him to build a devastating weapon. But instead, he builds an
armored suit and overcomes his captors. Stark’s initial pride blinds him
to responsibility, but as the story unfolds, he transforms into a hero,
using his intelligence for good. This is a powerful example of
redemption and restoration, an evolution from a flawed beginning to a
heroic end—much like the story of Naaman.

GUIDE: Direct attention to **The Point** on page 126 of the DDG. Invite
the group to fill in the blank<sup>:</sup> **God *****RESTORES***** us
as we are obedient to Him. **

PRAY: Transition into the study by asking God to help us trust and obey
Him as He works to restore us.

STUDY the BIBLE

**2 Kings 5:1-3**

**1 Naaman, commander of the army for the king of Aram, was a man
important to his master and highly regarded because through him, the
Lord had given victory to Aram. The man was a valiant warrior, but he
had a skin disease. 2 Aram had gone on raids and brought back from the
land of Israel a young girl who served Naaman’s wife. 3 She said to her
mistress, “If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria, he
would cure him of his skin disease.”**

**2 Kings 5:1-3 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **God used a Jewish servant girl to point
Naaman’s wife to the prophet of God.

**Aram** **(v. 1).** Aram was a loose confederation of cities and towns
sometimes referred to as Syria; it is also referred to by its most
prominent city, Damascus. The Old Testament mentions people from Aram on
several occasions. Deuteronomy 26:5 indicates Jacob and, by extension,
Abraham were Arameans. The father of Rebekah, Isaac’s wife, was “Bethuel
the Aramean of Paddan-aram” (Genesis 25:20). While there was never an
Aramean empire like those of the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Assyrians,
Arameans played a role in Old Testament history (for example: 2 Samuel
8:5-6; 10:8-19; 1 Kings 11:25; 20:1-29).

The shift in focus from the prophet Elisha (2 Kings 4) to the Aramean
Naaman (chapter 5) emphasizes that God’s focus was not limited to the
descendants of Abraham; God’s intention was to bless all the nations of
the earth through Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3). That **the Lord had given
victory to Aram **indicates God is sovereign over all nations and
history.

**Important . . . highly regarded** **(v. 1).** Two terms that describe
Naaman. The Hebrew term for “important” conveys the idea of greatness.
It can refer to greatness in physical size, quantity, degree, or social
status. In this context, Naaman was a powerful warrior and military
leader on whom the king of Aram depended. “Highly regarded” means to be
lifted up and further emphasizes Naaman’s greatness and importance.
Naaman was not just great because of his authority and power; he was
also held in high esteem by the king, the military, and most likely the
people of Aram. Through him, the Lord had given victory to Aram. While
the king and others elevated Naaman because of his military ability and
accomplishments, the Lord was ultimately responsible for Naaman’s power
and influence.

**Skin disease** **(v. 1).** While the Hebrew term can be translated as
“leprosy,” the generic phrase “skin disease” better conveys the meaning
of the Hebrew word because it is a collective term for a variety of
ailments of the skin. We don’t know with certainty the precise nature of
Naaman’s skin disease. From the immediate context, we can conclude it
was not so severe that it prevented Naaman from performing his military
and leadership duties. However, we also know the skin disease was
significant enough for the king of Aram to offer a huge amount of gold,
silver, and clothing to the king of Israel for Naaman to be healed (v.
5).

**A young girl who served** **(v. 2).** Naaman, “a valiant warrior” (v.
1), is contrasted with his wife’s young servant girl, an Israelite who
had been captured during an Aramean raid on Israel. This seemingly
powerless girl had knowledge of the prophet Elisha that the mighty
warrior Naaman did not. She knew this man of God could cure Naaman’s
skin disease.

**Israel . . . “Samaria”** **(vv. 2,3).** After the death of King
Solomon, the new king Rehoboam refused to lessen the hard service
Solomon had placed on the Israelites. So all the tribes of Israel except
Judah and Benjamin declared their independence under Jeroboam (1 Kings
12:1-17). The two nations were known as the Southern Kingdom of Judah
(under Rehoboam) and the Northern Kingdom of Israel (under Jeroboam).
Samaria, a city about forty-two miles from Jerusalem, eventually became
the capital of the Northern Kingdom.

In a figure of speech known as a synecdoche, where a small portion of a
larger thing is used to represent the whole (or vice versa), Samaria was
sometimes used as a synonym for the entire Northern Kingdom. In this
context, the young servant girl was not necessarily claiming she knew
Elisha was in the city of Samaria. Instead, she probably was saying that
Elisha lived and carried out his ministry in the Northern Kingdom of
Israel.

**2 Kings 5:10-12**

**10 Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, “Go wash seven times in
the Jordan and your skin will be restored and you will be clean.” 11 But
Naaman got angry and left, saying, “I was telling myself: He will surely
come out, stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his
hand over the place and cure the skin disease. 12 Aren’t Abana and
Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?
Couldn’t I wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and left in a
rage.**

**2 Kings 5:10-12 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **Elisha directed Naaman to wash in the
Jordan River, which initially offended Naaman.

**“Wash . . . in the Jordan”** **(v. 10).** The Jordan River served as a
geographical dividing line between the eastern and western tribes of
Israel. The longest river in Israel (more than two hundred miles), it
flows from Mount Hermon in the north down to the Dead Sea. Elisha’s
message to Naaman reflects the instructions God gave concerning ritual
cleansing in Leviticus 13–14. The Hebrew term for “wash” appears in
Leviticus 14:8-9; the term for **will be clean** appears about twenty
times in the two chapters in relation to skin diseases.

**“Seven times” (v. 10).** Throughout the Bible, the number seven
represents wholeness or completeness. By instructing Naaman to wash
himself seven times in the Jordan River, Elisha was looking for complete
obedience to his and, by extension, God’s instructions for Naaman. If
Naaman followed the instructions, God would heal him.

**“Restored”** **(v. 10).** The meaning of this Hebrew word is “to turn
back” or “return.” The term is associated with restoration, returning,
and repentance. In this context, there is probably a connection between
ceremonial washing, repentance, and restoration.

**Angry** **(v. 11).** By instructing Naaman to wash in the Jordan
River, Elisha was having Naaman perform a ritual cleansing that likely
would have been humiliating for him. From Naaman’s perspective, the
Jordan River was a small river in an insignificant and weak country, and
he was a great warrior, a servant of a king, and part of the elite in
his country.

Naaman was not merely annoyed or frustrated with Elisha’s suggestion. It
angered him to the point of wrath. First, Naaman expected Elisha to come
to see him personally, rather than only sending his servant with a
message. Second, he expected Elisha to do something spectacular, rather
than merely having Naaman perform a ritual washing in a local river.

**“He will surely come out”** **(v. 11).** Naaman’s words reflect at
least two concerns. First, he was a powerful and important man of Aram,
demonstrated by his arrival with an entourage of horses and chariots (v.
9). The presence of a man of such high social status called for a
greeting equal to his importance. Elisha’s use of a messenger rather
than coming himself to greet someone of Naaman’s stature and power would
have been seen as an insult.

Second, from Naaman’s perspective, the God of the Israelites was a local
deity who was manipulated by His prophet, Elisha. He expected Elisha to
greet him personally and work magic to heal him. This is reflected in
his words, **“He will surely come out, stand and call on the name of the
Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the skin
disease.”** Instead of humbly accepting what God had instructed him to
do through Elisha, Naaman acted arrogantly and tried to control the
situation (and by extension manipulate the God of the Israelites).

**“Abana and Pharpar”** **(v. 12).** Two rivers near Damascus in
Naaman’s homeland of Aram. The reason for Naaman’s desire to wash in
these two rivers rather than the Jordan River is not stated. Some
suggest these rivers may have been clearer compared to the muddy Jordan
River; others note Naaman’s desire may have been an expression of
national pride and/or familiarity with his homeland.

**Rage** **(v. 12).** The Hebrew term for *rage* could also be
translated as “burning anger” and comes from a root word meaning “heat”
or “to become hot.” The term is used for both God’s holy wrath (Numbers
25:11; Deuteronomy 29:28) and the subjective wrath of human beings (2
Samuel 11:20). For the reasons stated above, Naaman’s blood was
figuratively boiling over both from Elisha’s treatment of him and the
prophet’s instructions. Rather than obey, Naaman stormed away in a rage.

**2 Kings 5:13-19a**

**13 But his servants approached and said to him, “My father, if the
prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it?
How much more should you do it when he only tells you, ‘Wash and be
clean’?” 14 So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven
times, according to the command of the man of God. Then his skin was
restored and became like the skin of a small boy, and he was clean. 15
Then Naaman and his whole company went back to the man of God, stood
before him, and declared, “I know there’s no God in the whole world
except in Israel. Therefore, please accept a gift from your servant.” 16
But Elisha said, “As the Lord lives, in whose presence I stand, I will
not accept it.” Naaman urged him to accept it, but he refused. 17 Naaman
responded, “If not, please let your servant be given as much soil as a
pair of mules can carry, for your servant will no longer offer a burnt
offering or a sacrifice to any other god but the Lord. 18 However, in a
particular matter may the Lord pardon your servant: When my master, the
king of Aram, goes into the temple of Rimmon to bow in worship while he
is leaning on my arm, and I have to bow in the temple of Rimmon—when I
bow in the temple of Rimmon, may the Lord pardon your servant in this
matter.” 19a So he said to him, “Go in peace.”**

**2 Kings 5:13-19a **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **Naaman humbled himself, washed in the
Jordan River, and was healed.

**“My father”** **(v. 13).** The servants speaking to Naaman were not
Naaman’s children. The use of familial language to imply a close
relationship is common in the Bible and in many cultures today. We have
already seen this in the relationship between Elijah and Elisha.
Additionally, the “sons of the prophets” mentioned in 1 and 2 Kings were
not biological sons of the prophets. Instead, they were members of a
prophetic order or guild under the leadership and guidance of a more
spiritually mature man of God whom they called “master” (vv. 3,5). In a
similar way, the servants speaking to Naaman were addressing him
respectfully and acknowledging their subservience to him.

**“Clean”** **(v. 13).** The Hebrew word has a deep and holistic
meaning. It is used in the sense of both ceremonial and moral purity.
The laws of Leviticus and Deuteronomy taught that impure people could
not enter the tabernacle (the presence of the Lord). Jews who heard or
read the story of Naaman would have had this distinction between pure
and impure in mind.

Naaman’s outward healing from the skin disease was vitally important to
his life. The more important transformation happened in Naaman’s heart,
as demonstrated by his words, “I know there’s no God *in the whole
world* except in Israel” (v. 15, emphasis added). This confession is
remarkable given that Naaman was a man of high standing from a pagan
background where people believed in and worshiped a pantheon of gods and
goddesses. By making this profession of faith in the presence of both
Elisha and Naaman’s entire entourage, the healed man was rejecting his
past pagan beliefs and declaring his allegiance to Yahweh alone.

**“Please accept a gift”** **(v. 15).** Naaman’s response to being cured
was to offer a gift to the prophet of God. However, just as Elisha
downplayed his role and elevated God by not personally coming out to
greet Naaman or performing the healing miracle, now he did the same by
refusing Naaman’s offering of a gift. It was God who healed Naaman, and
it was God alone Naaman should thank for being cured of his skin
disease.

**“Soil”** **(v. 17).** Naaman wanted to take two loads of dirt from
Yahweh’s special land to construct an altar for worship in his homeland.
This territorial understanding of deities was common in the ancient Near
East, as was the transportation of dirt from a deity’s territory
(essentially transporting “land” over which a deity ruled into the
territory of another god). While Naaman’s words indicate an incomplete
understanding of who the Lord is, still his faith was directed
exclusively toward Him.

**“The temple of Rimmon”** **(v. 18).** Rimmon was the chief Syrian god
associated with storms and thunder. What this false god could not do,
God had done by healing Naaman. Despite his newfound faith, Naaman’s
duties for the king of Aram included accompanying the king into Rimmon’s
temple when the king worshiped the pagan god.

**“Leaning on my arm”** **(v. 18).** There are at least two
possibilities behind this phrase. First, it is possible that the king of
Aram was an old man who physically needed help walking, and Naaman was
tasked with carrying out that duty. The second, more probable, scenario
is that this expression refers to a ceremonial responsibility Naaman had
as the commander of the Aramean army. In either case, Naaman told Elisha
that he would not participate in worship in these situations but rather
just accompany his king.

**“Go in peace” (v. 19a).** With these words, Elisha indicated that
Naaman’s heart orientation toward God was correct.
