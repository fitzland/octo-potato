Session 2

**God’s Hand in Meeting Our Needs**

The Point

God provides for our needs.

The Passage

2 Kings 4:1-7

Life Connection

A good business practice is to assess what you have and work with what
you’ve got. That wisdom applies to our personal lives as well: We can’t
spend or use what we don’t have. Thankfully, we serve a God who isn’t
limited in what He can do or provide. When we’re lacking in some area of
our lives, we can call to Him and trust Him to provide what we need,
when we need it.

Background

The mention of the jar of oil should cause readers to remember how God
provided for the widow in Elijah’s ministry (1 Kings 17:8-16) and create
an expectation that God would perform a similar miracle in this
situation. In both cases, the Lord provided for a person society had
cast aside. The Lord used ordinary, everyday products essential to life
and their containers to perform the miracles.

The miracles of Elijah and Elisha have both similarities and
differences. Elijah performed the miracle at Zarephath near Sidon (north
of Israel in Phoenicia, 1 Kings 17:9); the miracle of Elisha apparently
took place in Israel. Both widows were in a state of desperate need.
Elijah’s widow was facing starvation (1 Kings 17:10-12); Elisha’s widow
was facing both poverty and the loss of her children to a creditor (2
Kings 4:1-2). Elijah’s miracle focused on a flour jar and an oil jug,
which remained full until the drought the land was experiencing was over
(1 Kings 17:14-16); Elisha’s miracle used a hands-on approach. The
prophet commanded the widow and her sons to gather many empty containers
and pour oil from her jar into the empty containers. Oil flowed from the
single jar into the containers until no empty containers remained (2
Kings 4:3-6). Both miracles supplied food for the widows and their
families. The widow in Elijah’s case was provided with flour and oil to
make food; in Elisha’s miracle, he commanded the widow to sell the oil
to pay her creditor and provide for her family (1 Kings 17:16; 2 Kings
4:7).

Getting started

Discuss: Give your group an opportunity to discuss **Question \#1 **on
page 105 of the Daily Discipleship Guide (DDG): **When have you received
help that arrived at just the right time?**

Recap (DDG, page 106): Invite a volunteer to read **The Bible Meets
Life** to introduce the session:

Thanks to the ten-dollar bill and a Broadway hit, we’re all familiar
with the name Alexander Hamilton. But we would have never heard of this
key figure in American history if he hadn’t had some help along the way.
Hamilton’s life was filled with trials and triumphs. Orphaned and
destitute at the age of eleven, people rallied to raise funds for his
education, enabling Hamilton to travel to America. Through a series of
fortuitous encounters, he secured a job that not only provided a stable
income but also laid the foundation for his future success. Hamilton
landed well because others provided. We have someone who provides for us
in ways far better than Hamilton ever received. Even in our darkest
moments, God will meet our needs.

STUDY the BIBLE

**2 Kings 4:1-2**

**1 One of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha,
“Your servant, my husband, has died. You know that your servant feared
the Lord. Now the creditor is coming to take my two children as his
slaves.” 2 Elisha asked her, “What can I do for you? Tell me, what do
you have in the house?” She said, “Your servant has nothing in the house
except a jar of oil.”**

**2 Kings 4:1-2 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **A woman made her need known to God’s
prophet.

**One of the wives of the sons of the prophets** **(v. 1).** *“*The sons
of the prophets” indicates a community or guild of prophets. When Elijah
was taken into heaven and Elisha performed miracles, the sons of the
prophets bowed before Elisha, recognizing that Elisha’s power was the
same power Elijah had possessed (2:15-18). Later events (4:38-41; 6:1-7)
indicate Elisha’s role as supervisor over the sons of the prophets.

In biblical times, widows were in a very vulnerable position. They often
lacked economic, legal, and physical means of support and could easily
be taken advantage of. In this instance, the widow possessed only a jar
of oil, and a creditor was approaching to take her children as slaves as
payment for her debt. The vulnerability of widows led to the early
church designating certain men to oversee both Greek and Jewish widows,
so the daily needs of all the widows would be met (Acts 6:1-6; of the
early church’s emphasis on the care of widows and orphans see James
1:27).

**“Your servant” (v. 1).** The term *servant* can refer to one who
serves God, kings, and rulers, as well as anyone who serves a superior.
The word was also commonly used for polite address among equals or in
relation to one superior in rank. Most likely, the woman was using the
term as an expression of humility toward Elisha. The phrase would also
have been appropriate, since her husband had been one of the sons of the
prophets; Elisha would have been her husband’s superior. That the widow
was one of the wives of the sons of the prophets indicates that the sons
of the prophets were permitted to marry.

**“Feared the Lord” (v. 1).** By mentioning that her dead husband had
feared the Lord, the widow was communicating to Elisha that he was a man
who loved and served God with his heart, soul, mind, and strength (see
Deuteronomy 6:4-6; Mark 12:28-30). *Lord* is a substitution for God’s
covenant name *Yahweh*, which was viewed as too holy to speak lest it be
mispronounced. *Yahweh* emphasizes God’s eternal self-existence and
self-sufficiency. It is also the title by which God as Creator and
Redeemer called the Israelites into relationship with Him (Exodus
3:13-15).

**“The creditor”** **(v. 1).** In the ancient Near East, the practice of
enslaving a person’s wife and/or children as a form of debt payment was
common. The person receiving the loan made a pledge in the form of
property as collateral on the loan, sometimes pledging himself and/or
members of his family against the loan. However, God gave the laws found
in the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament)—especially
Deuteronomy 15:1-18— as instructions for the care of the poor and
vulnerable among His people, those who were indebted and enslaved. While
in Israelite society everyone was responsible for looking out for the
poor and vulnerable, it was particularly the role of a family member
(known as the kinsman redeemer) to deliver his relatives from
indebtedness and slavery (Leviticus 25:47-55). The Hebrew prophets
condemned the rich for their abuse of the poor and helpless of society
and called on God’s people to care for them. That this widow had fallen
into such a desperate situation indicates that God’s instructions and
provisions for the poor had been either forgotten or ignored. However,
through God’s power, Elisha would take on the role of this widow’s
redeemer.

**“A jar of oil”** **(v. 2).** The term for “jar” is used only here in
the Hebrew Old Testament. It was most likely a small container. Some
suggest in this instance that it was not the standard type of jar used
for storing oil in a home, but rather a small bottle or flask used for
anointing. This would have further emphasized the destitute state of the
widow and her two children.

**2 Kings 4:3-4**

**3 Then he said, “Go out and borrow empty containers from all your
neighbors. Do not get just a few. 4 Then go in and shut the door behind
you and your sons, and pour oil into all these containers. Set the full
ones to one side.”**

> many jars as possible and then “go in and shut the door behind you and

**2 Kings 4:3-4 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **Elisha directed the woman to collect jars
to be prepared for how God would provide.

**“Borrow”** **(v. 3). **The Hebrew term for “borrow” in this context
means to ask as a favor for temporary use.

**“Empty containers”** **(v. 3).** Storage containers were typically
tall oval or pear-shaped jars about twenty-five inches in height and
sixteen inches in diameter, having two or four handles. The bases were
usually rounded, coming to a point. They were placed in stands, in the
holes of wood planks, or pressed into the ground.

The Hebrew term for *containers* has a wide range of meanings. It was
the general term for a vessel, object, or utensil. More specifically, it
could refer to bags, vessels, or containers (1 Samuel 17:49; 1 Kings
17:10), weapons and armor (1 Samuel 14:13; 2 Kings 11:11), musical
instruments (1 Chronicles 15:16; 16:42), tools for working (1 King 6:7),
a yoke for animals such as oxen (2 Samuel 24:22), for furniture or
furnishings (Exodus 31:7; 39:33), for jewelry (Exodus 3:22), and even
for boats made out of papyrus reeds. In this instance, identifying the
borrowed vessels as empty containers emphasizes that they were
commonplace, everyday vessels God would use to perform a miracle. The
focus is on God, not the vessels themselves.

The apostle Paul wrote, “Now we have this treasure in clay jars, so that
this extraordinary power may be from God and not from us” (2 Corinthians
4:7). While he did not indicate what this treasure is, most likely it
refers to the gospel. Clay jars were both ordinary and fragile. As
believers, we are the conduits God uses to proclaim the message of
salvation through Jesus Christ. We should be humbled when we are
compared to ordinary jars; there is nothing about us that deserves to be
used by God. However, we should be encouraged and emboldened to action
because God accomplishes His purposes through ordinary, everyday people
like us.

**“Do not get just a few”** **(v. 3).** Elisha was expecting God to do
great things, so he instructed the widow to get more than just a few
containers. The miracle God would perform for the widow was greater than
the small container of oil she possessed (v. 2). The prophet wanted the
widow to see that God could do great things in her life. God’s miracle
was going to be extravagant.

All our efforts for the kingdom will only be effective inasmuch as we
are dependent and expectant that God can and will do great things. We
can and should trust that God “is able to do above and beyond all that
we ask or think according to the power that works in us” (Ephesians
3:20). This is the very nature of faith itself—which has God as its
object. We trust what God has already done through Jesus Christ to
redeem us, and we step out in faith, trusting and expecting in hope for
what God has promised to do for us and through us in the future.

**“Oil”** **(v. 4).** A major component of life in ancient Israel. The
most common oil was made from olives, due to the abundance of olive
trees in Israel. The oil was extracted from olives using an olive press.
Olive oil was used in food preparation and was an essential part of
people’s diets. It was also used as fuel for lamps (Exodus 25:6; Matthew
25:3), as medicine in treating wounds (Isaiah 1:6; Luke 10:34), for
perfume and skin care (Ruth 3:3), and in religious ceremonies such as
anointing kings (1 Samuel 10:1), priests (Leviticus 8:30), objects such
as altars (Leviticus 8:11), markers or pillars (Genesis 35:14), and the
tabernacle and its furnishings (Exodus 40:9-11; Leviticus 8:10). Because
of the many uses of oil in daily life, it was also an important
commodity of trade. As such, it was a resource the widow could sell both
to pay her family’s debt and have money on which to live (2 Kings 4:7).

**2 Kings 4:5-7**

**5 So she left. After she had shut the door behind her and her sons,
they kept bringing her containers, and she kept pouring. 6 When they
were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.” But he
replied, “There aren’t any more.” Then the oil stopped. 7 She went and
told the man of God, and he said, “Go sell the oil and pay your debt;
you and your sons can live on the rest.”**

**2 Kings 4:5-7 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **God miraculously filled every jar with oil.

**Shut the door** **(v. 5).** This entire event in which God
miraculously provided a massive amount of oil for the widow took place
in secret—behind a closed door. The widow’s neighbors provided the
containers, but they did not see what happened as her little vessel of
oil continued to fill container after container. That the miracle took
place in secret at the hands of the widow and not in the presence of the
prophet. Elisha emphasized that God and His power were the source of the
miracle and demonstrated His care and mercy toward the widow and her
sons.

Scripture often encourages us to share publicly how God has provided,
and there are times we should declare that the Lord has done great
things for us. Psalm 126 and other passages like it testify that the
nations will be drawn to God because of the great things He does for and
through His people. Jesus commanded His disciples, “You are the light of
the world. A city situated on a hill cannot be hidden. No one lights a
lamp and puts it under a basket, but rather on a lampstand, and it gives
light for all who are in the house. In the same way, let your light
shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory
to your Father in heaven” (Matthew 5:14-16). However, this session
passage indicates that there are also times when God’s blessings on our
lives can and should remain a private matter—just between us and God.
Regarding both giving to the poor and prayer (6:1-6), Jesus commanded
that these actions be done in secret and “your Father who sees in secret
will reward you” (vv. 3-4,6).

**“Pay”** **(v. 7). **The Hebrew term means to complete or finish. It
can mean to make good (in the sense of paying one’s debts) or to make
whole or good (in the sense of restoration). The Hebrew word contains
the same consonants as and is related to the term *shalom*. *Shalom* is
often translated “peace”; however, it carries a wider range of meaning
than simply the absence of conflict. The Hebrew concept of shalom is a
picture of wholeness and completeness. The widow was not only able to
pay her existing debt; she and her sons were able to live on the rest.
God met the widow’s immediate need and provided for the daily needs of
her family as well.

God’s provision in the life of this widow foreshadows God’s provision
through the atoning work of Christ available to all who repent and place
their faith in Jesus as Savior and Lord. The initial moment of
justification (when all the believer’s sins are forgiven, he or she is
reconciled to God and permanently receives the perfect righteousness of
Christ) is followed by the ongoing process of sanctification (the
life-long process of being transformed into the image of Christ in one’s
character and behavior).

Live it out

Ask: What actions will you take in response to today’s study?

Guide: Direct your group to review the three bulleted statements under
**Live It Out **on page 108 of the DDG. Call on volunteers to share (1)
which of these statements is something they want to pursue further, or
(2) ways this study will transform their understanding of how God
provides for their needs.

- **Talk with God. **What lesser things do you turn to when life brings
  > difficulty? Commit to spending time each day with God. Take your
  > difficult moments to Him for wisdom and help, trusting He’ll provide
  > for you.

- **Thank God. **When you pray for your need, go ahead and thank God for
  > hearing and answering. Thank Him for His goodness and generosity.
  > Thank Him for allowing the need so you can seek His help and grow in
  > your walk with Him.

- **Include others.** Involve others in praying and waiting for God’s
  > provision with you. Share your need with a few friends or your small
  > group and ask them to partner with you in prayer.

Wrap It Up

GUIDE: Invite each person to gather with two or three Christ-followers
of the same gender this week for a deeper discussion, using **Talk It
Out** (page 108 of the DDG) to guide their discussion. Encourage your
group to spend time each day in God’s Word with the **Daily Study**
section (pages 109-114 of the DDG).

RECAP: Read or restate from page 108 of the DDG.

> God miraculously filled every jar with oil, and the wording of 2 Kings
> 4:6 suggests that the oil stopped flowing only because there were no
> more containers. God desires to meet our needs. There’s no reason to
> hesitate to cry out to Him.

Pray: Close your group time with prayer, thanking God for the way He
provides for our needs.

Engage

The widow had faith, but she also had a part to play in God’s miraculous
provision. Think of a situation in your life where you’re in need. Ask
yourself the following questions:

**Have I asked God to meet my need? **

**Do I believe God can and will meet my need? **

**How could I “gather more jars” in anticipation of His provision? **
