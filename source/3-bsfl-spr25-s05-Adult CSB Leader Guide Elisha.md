God’s Hand in  
Facing Opposition

The Point

God is more powerful than those who oppose us.

The Passage

2 Kings 6:8-12,15-23

The Bible Meets Life

When I was a teenager, I played on our church basketball team. Doyle was
our center. Our arch-rival was a church across town. During the game,
the center for the opposing team fouled out and blamed Doyle. When he
walked to the bench, he pointed a finger at Doyle and said, “I’ll be
waiting for you in the parking lot.” He was a lot bigger than Doyle and
the threat had Doyle shook up. After the game ended, our team decided we
weren’t going to let Doyle face the other guy alone. So, as we left the
gym and walked out to the parking lot, we were one big group huddled
together with Doyle in the middle.

As believers, the opposition we face isn’t always as apparent as in this
story, but it is real, nonetheless. Every believer engages in some level
of spiritual warfare against Satan and his schemes. Thankfully, we don’t
stand alone. God Himself stands with us whenever we face opposition.

**2 Kings 6:8-12**

**8 When the king of Aram was waging war against Israel, he conferred
with his servants, “My camp will be at such and such a place.” 9 But the
man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Be careful passing by this
place, for the Arameans are going down there.” 10 Consequently, the king
of Israel sent word to the place the man of God had told him about. The
man of God repeatedly warned the king, so the king would be on his
guard. 11 The king of Aram was enraged because of this matter, and he
called his servants and demanded of them, “Tell me, which one of us is
for the king of Israel?” 12 One of his servants said, “No one, my lord
the king. Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel even
the words you speak in your bedroom.”**

**2 Kings 6:8-12 **Commentary

**Connection to The Point: **Elisha informed the king of Israel of the
actions of the Aramean army.

**King of Aram** **(v. 8).** Whereas previously the king of Israel had
mistakenly feared the king of Aram (Syria) was trying to goad him into a
conflict (5:7), now the two nations were at war. It is probable that at
this time Aram’s military was stronger than that of Israel. This was
suggested earlier when the king of Israel had thought the king of Aram
was trying to pick a fight with him by requesting he heal the Aramean
Naaman’s skin disease; the Israelite king tore his clothes, an
expression of grief and mourning, acknowledging that his kingdom could
not win against the might of the Arameans.

In both instances, neither the king of Aram nor the king of Israel
understood the nature and power of God. While that is not surprising for
a pagan king, what is shocking is the king of Israel’s lack of
understanding. His role was to lead God’s people in living in a covenant
relationship with Yahweh, the God of Israel. Instead, he viewed life
from merely an earthly, human perspective.

**Waging war** **(v. 8). **King David had successfully defeated and
occupied Aram (2 Sam. 8:5-6; 10:6-19), but during the time of King
Solomon the Arameans waged war against Israel (1 Kings 11:25). Then when
Israel split into the Northern Kingdom of Israel (Samaria) and the
Southern Kingdom of Judah after Solomon’s death, the Arameans took
advantage of the weaknesses that came with the nation’s division. The
relationship between Aram and the two kingdoms would continue—sometimes
as enemies, sometimes as allies—until the Assyrians conquered Aram and
deported the Arameans in 732 BC. It has been suggested by Bible students
that the type of warfare referenced here are raids and ambushes by the
Arameans.

The true strength of the Israelites was not their army, but rather their
God. In a somewhat amusing scenario, every time the king of Aram made a
military decision related to the conflict with the kingdom of Israel,
God revealed the king’s plans to the prophet Elijah, who then warned the
king of Israel. As a result, Israel’s army was able to evade the Aramean
army’s attempted ambushes. So, while the two countries were at war, very
little actual fighting was taking place.

**Enraged (v. 11).** The king of Aram became enraged, believing one of
his servants was revealing his plans to the king of Israel. The literal
meaning of the Hebrew term refers to a great wind or a violent storm. In
much the same way that hurricane winds rage, the king of Aram got
stirred up because he believed one of his servants was betraying him.

**“My lord”** **(v. 12).** The Hebrew word for the covenant name of God,
Yahweh, is indicated in the Old Testament by the word “Lord.” In this
instance, the word translated “lord” does not refer to God. The servant
in this verse was identifying the Aramean king as his master or ruler,
recognizing his authority over the servant.

**“Your bedroom”** **(v. 12).** The servant explained that none of the
king’s people were betraying him. Rather it was the prophet Elisha who
knew all the king’s plans, even the most private conversations the king
had in his most intimate space, his bedroom. Elisha’s knowledge about
all the king of Aram’s plans was not due to human informants or double
agents embedded among the Arameans. Rather, Elisha had access to the
king of Aram’s plans through supernatural means. Yahweh, the God of
Israel, was revealing those plans to the prophet, who then related them
to the king of Israel.

**2 Kings 6:15-17**

**15 When the servant of the man of God got up early and went out, he
discovered an army with horses and chariots surrounding the city. So he
asked Elisha, “Oh, my master, what are we to do?” 16 Elisha said, “Don’t
be afraid, for those who are with us outnumber those who are with them.”
17 Then Elisha prayed, “Lord, please open his eyes and let him see.” So
the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he saw that the mountain was
covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.**

**2 Kings 6:15-17 **Commentary

**Connection to the Point.** God protected His people with an unseen
army.

**Context.** Knowing that Elisha was thwarting his battle plans, the
king of Aram sought to capture the prophet. He received intelligence
that Elisha was in Dothan, so the king dispatched a massive army by
night to seize the prophet. The scene is somewhat humorous and ironic.
Since God had revealed all the previous plans of the king of Aram to
Elisha, what made the Aramean king think his plan to capture the prophet
would escape God’s notice this time?

One of the reasons the king of Aram did not understand who he was
dealing with was due to his bad theology—he did not understand the
nature of Almighty God. The false gods he worshiped were merely idols,
blocks of stone and wood. They were powerless. In contrast, the one true
God is omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing), and
omnipresent (He is capable of being present everywhere at once). Nothing
escapes His notice. Therefore, the king of Aram’s plan to capture Elisha
was doomed from the start. The king’s futile attempt to silence Elisha
is reminiscent of attempts that were made to capture or kill the prophet
Elijah (1 Kings 19:1-2; 2 Kings 1:9-15).

**The servant of the man of God** **(v. 15).** In this instance, the
name of the servant of Elisha is not given. Based on 2 Kings 8:4-5 where
he is explicitly named as Gehazi, this servant is likely the same person
who appeared in the earlier account related to the Aramean commander,
Naaman (2 Kings 5). In that episode, Gehazi had approached Naaman after
the commander of the Aramean military had been cured of his skin
disease. While Elisha had refused to take the reward Naaman offered for
being cured, Gehazi had taken the reward for himself. After being
confronted by Elisha and lying about his actions, Gehazi was stricken
with the same skin disease that had afflicted Naaman. The end of chapter
5 declares that Gehazi and his descendants would perpetually have the
same skin disease. Bible students suggest that in an incredible example
of the mercy of God, Gehazi was not left in that diseased state; he was
healed. In an equally incredible example of the God’s grace, Gehazi was
restored to a place of honor of serving the prophet.

**“Those who are with us”** **(v. 16).** While human beings usually view
life in this world from a physical perspective, there is also a
spiritual realm which is just as real and is populated by spiritual
beings both good and evil. Just as human armies battle in the physical
world, spiritual armies wage war in this other realm. For example, when
the prophet Daniel prayed seeking to understand a revelation he had
received from God, an angel was dispatched to explain the meaning of the
revelation to the prophet. However, the angel was hindered for
twenty-one days by an evil spiritual being identified as “the prince of
the kingdom of Persia.” It was only after the angel Michael came to
assist the messenger angel that he was able to fulfill his mission to
Daniel. The messenger also told Daniel that when the angel left, the
battle would continue as “the prince of Greece” would join the prince of
Persia against the messenger angel and Michael (Dan. 10:10-21). Another
reference to this spiritual realm is made by Jesus in the garden of
Gethsemane; He spoke of how if He asked, God the Father would put twelve
legions of angels (seventy-two thousand) at His disposal (Matt. 26:53).

**“Open his eyes”** **(v. 17). **Elisha’s request did not refer to his
servant’s physical eyes; his servant was not blind in the sense of not
being able to see the physical world around him. Instead, Elisha asked
God to give his servant spiritual eyes to see the true reality of their
situation. The servant’s “natural” reaction was to panic at the sight of
the massive Aramean army that surrounded Dothan. But Elisha, the prophet
of God, recognized that the omnipotent power of God was with him to
protect him and his servant.

**Horses and chariots of fire (v. 17).** These words identify the forces
sent by God to protect Elisha. They are a contrast to the relatively
feeble power of the king of Aram, who sent “horses, chariots, and a
massive army” to seize Elisha (v. 14). These horses and chariots of fire
recall the means by which the prophet Elijah had been taken up into
heaven in a whirlwind (2:11-12). Fire in both instances indicates the
presence of God.

**2 Kings 6:18-23**

**18 When the Arameans came against him, Elisha prayed to the Lord,
“Please strike this nation with blindness.” So he struck them with
blindness, according to Elisha’s word. 19 Then Elisha said to them,
“This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will
take you to the man you’re looking for.” And he led them to Samaria. 20
When they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “Lord, open these men’s eyes and
let them see.” So the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw that they
were in the middle of Samaria. 21 When the king of Israel saw them, he
said to Elisha, “Should I kill them, should I kill them, my father?” 22
Elisha replied, “Don’t kill them. Do you kill those you have captured
with your sword or your bow? Set food and water in front of them so they
can eat and drink and go to their master.” 23 So he prepared a big feast
for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they
went to their master. The Aramean raiders did not come into Israel’s
land again.**

**2 Kings 6:18-23 **Commentary

**Connection to the Point.** Under Elisha’s direction, the king of
Israel treated the captured army with mercy.

**“Strike this nation with blindness”** **(v. 18).** In contrast to
Elisha’s prayer that his servant’s eyes would be opened to see the host
God had sent to protect the prophet and his servant, Elisha now
addressed the Aramean army surrounding them. While Elisha and his
servant were protected by God’s horses and chariots of fire, Elisha went
a step further in order to protect the Israelites, asking God to strike
the Aramean army with blindness. God granted Elisha’s prayer, and the
Aramean army was rendered blind.

**“The man you’re looking for”** **(v. 19).** The Aramean soldiers were
sent by their king to go to Dothan to look for the troublemaker Elisha
and to capture him. Ironically, the man speaking to them and “helping”
them was the very man whom they were looking for! Yet, their blindness
left them unable to recognize the man that they were seeking was in
front of them. Instead of capturing Elisha, they were in effect his
captives. Whereas they had laid siege in Dothan around the prophet, now
the man they were seeking guided them into the presence of the king of
Israel, where the Arameans were at the king’s mercy.

**Entered Samaria** **(v. 20).** Sometime after Israel split into two
nations with the death of King Solomon, Samaria became the capital of
the Northern Kingdom of Israel (Samaria). It was located in the central
highlands, about forty-two miles north of Jerusalem. King Omri, the
kingdom’s sixth ruler (reigned 885–874 BC), purchased the hill of
Samaria for his residence and relocated the capital of the Northern
Kingdom to Samaria. The city’s location on a hill provided a significant
military advantage. The Syrians twice laid siege to the city but were
unsuccessful in their attempts to capture it (1 Kings 20; 2 Kings 6).
The city eventually fell to the Assyrians after a three-year siege (2
Kings 17:5; 18:9-12).

When the Assyrians captured Samaria, most of the residents were
deported, but some of the remaining Israelites eventually intermarried
with the foreigners the Assyrians settled in the region (17:24). In the
time of the New Testament, the central part of Israel (located between
Galilee to the north and Judea to the south) was known as Samaria.
Because of their intermarriage with Gentiles and their syncretistic
religion (mixing the worship of Yahweh with that of false gods), a great
animosity developed between the Samaritans and the Jews.

**King of Israel** **(v. 21).** The text does not name the specific king
of Israel involved in these events. However, whatever his name, the
account does not portray him as a godly king and makes clear that it was
not his leadership that saved the people of Israel. Instead, it was God
through His power and His prophet Elisha who saved both the king and the
people of Israel from the army of Aram.

One of the major themes of both the historical books and the prophets is
that the kings of both the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the Southern
Kingdom of Judah often failed in their role as spiritual leaders of
their peoples. Whereas those two nations were called to be witnesses to
the world as God’s people, they often ended up living just like their
pagan neighbors.

**“My father”** **(v. 21).** While the king of Israel was the leader of
his people, in this instance he recognized Elisha, the prophet of God,
as being his spiritual superior. The king looked to Elisha for
permission to do what he desired—to kill the captive Aramean soldiers
who were at his mercy.

**A big feast** **(v. 23).** When the king of Israel saw that the
Aramean soldiers were his helpless captives, he asked Elisha if he
should kill them. Instead of endorsing the king’s plan, Elisha
instructed the king that he should give the Arameans food and water and
let the soldiers return to their master, the king of Aram (see Prov.
25:21-22; Rom. 12:20-21).

The Israelite king wanted to give the Aramean soldiers judgment and
death, which would have been the expected response. An invading army
intent on ambushing, killing, and kidnapping people deserved death.
However, Elisha told the king to offer them mercy and grace. Mercy is
not receiving the punishment deserved. Grace is being given benefits
which are undeserved. Instead of death, the Arameans were treated to a
great feast.
