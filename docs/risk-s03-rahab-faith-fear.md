# Rahab. Faith Over Fear
[Joshua 2:1-4, 8-14, 6:22-25](https://biblehub.com/bsb/joshua/2.htm), BSB

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

**A**. Describe a time you showed hospitality to a stranger. What was the situation?

**B**. When have you had to go against the consensus of your family, friends, or community because you believed it was the right thing to do?

*True faith often requires courageous action when everyone else is paralyzed by fear.*

### Core Message

**True faith sees God’s power, confesses His sovereignty, and acts with courageous hospitality, even when surrounded by a culture of fear.**

## 1. City Gripped by Fear

**The report of God’s power brought paralyzing fear to Jericho’s inhabitants.**

!!! quote "Joshua 2:1-4, 8-9, BSB"

    **1** Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim, saying, “Go, inspect the land, especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
    
    **2** And it was reported to the king of Jericho: “Behold, some men of Israel have come here tonight to spy out the land.” **3** So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab and said, “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, for they have come to spy out the whole land.”
    
    **4** But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them...
    
    **8** Now before the spies went to sleep, Rahab went up to the roof **9** and said to them, “I know that the LORD has given you this land and that the fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of you.

### Context & Insights

The mission begins in secret, under the cover of darkness. Two spies infiltrate the formidable city of Jericho, lodging in the house of Rahab, a prostitute. Their presence is immediately detected, and the king of Jericho—the highest authority in the city—reacts with alarm. The entire city is on high alert.

- *Secretly*. Joshua is already acting on the command to be strong and courageous, but he is also being wise and strategic. Faith and prudence are not opposites.

- *A prostitute named Rahab*. Rahab's profession and location (her house was part of the city wall) made her establishment a strategic place for travelers to pass through without immediate notice. She was a marginalized person in a strategic location.

- *Melting in fear*. The Hebrew word for *melting* (*moog*) paints a vivid picture of utter demoralization. The stories of God's power had not led Jericho to repentance, but to a state of collective, paralyzing terror. Their hearts had dissolved; they were incapable of acting.

**Illustration**. Imagine a city hearing that an unstoppable army is headed its way. The gates are locked, the guards are on high alert, and rumors spread like wildfire, causing panic in every home. People are frozen, waiting for the inevitable. This was Jericho. Fear had them in its grip. But in one house, on the edge of the city, fear was about to be turned into faith.

!!! question "Fear vs. Faith"

    1. The people of Jericho heard about God's power and were paralyzed by fear. Rahab heard the same reports and was moved to faith. What is the difference between a fear that paralyzes and a fear of the Lord that leads to wisdom?

#### Common Answers

**Focus of the Fear**. Paralyzing fear focuses on the *threat* and our inability to overcome it. Godly fear (reverence) focuses on God's awesome *power* and our complete dependence on Him, leading to trust and obedience.

**Response to Fear**. Paralyzing fear leads to inaction, hiding, and self-preservation at all costs. Godly fear leads to proactive faith, seeking mercy, and aligning with God's purposes.

**Outcome of Fear**. Paralyzing fear ends in despair and destruction. Godly fear ends in wisdom, salvation, and life. (Proverbs 9:10)

*Dig Deeper*. How can we actively cultivate a "fear of the Lord" that overcomes the paralyzing fears of our culture (fear of failure, fear of man, fear of the future)?

### Practical Application

**Identify Your Fears**. What news or circumstances are causing you to *melt in fear* right now? Name them.

**Shift Your Focus**. Instead of dwelling on the threat, consciously shift your focus to what you know about God's power and faithfulness. Find a promise in Scripture that speaks to your situation.

*Transition*. While the king and his soldiers reacted with predictable force, this marginalized woman responded with an unpredictable act of faith.

## 2. Unlikely Act of Faith

**While her city was paralyzed by fear, Rahab acted in faith, choosing to protect God’s messengers at great personal risk.**

!!! quote "Joshua 2:4-7, BSB"

    **4** But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. So she said, “Yes, the men did come to me, but I didn’t know where they were from. **5** At nightfall, when the city gate was about to close, the men went out, and I don’t know where they were going. Chase after them quickly, and you can catch up with them!”
    
    **6** (But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)
    
    **7** So the men pursued them along the road to the Jordan as far as the fords, and as soon as the pursuers had left, the gate was shut.

### Context & Insights

Rahab's moment of decision arrives. The king's men are at her door. To obey them would be the safe, logical choice. To defy them is treason, punishable by death. In this critical moment, she makes a courageous choice. She acts decisively, hiding the men and fabricating a story to send their pursuers on a futile chase.

- *She had taken... and hidden them*. Her action is decisive and premeditated. Before the king's men even arrived, she had already chosen her side. Faith acts.

- *Stalks of flax*. This detail shows the reality of her daily life—using the roof to dry flax for making linen. She used the ordinary materials of her life to accomplish an extraordinary act of deliverance.

- *The gate was shut*. This detail heightens the tension. The spies are now trapped in the city, and Rahab's fate is irrevocably tied to theirs. There is no turning back.

**Illustration**. It’s like a scene from a World War II movie where a family hides refugees in their attic. When the soldiers knock on the door, the homeowner doesn't hesitate. They calmly lie, misdirecting the patrol, knowing that if they are discovered, their entire family will be executed. It's a life-or-death gamble based on the conviction that they are doing the right thing. Rahab placed the same kind of bet.

!!! question "Faith in Action"

    1. Hebrews 11:31 says, *By faith the prostitute Rahab did not perish... because she welcomed the spies*. How does Rahab’s lie fit with her being a hero of faith?

#### Common Answers

**Choosing a Higher Law**. Rahab was faced with two conflicting laws: the king of Jericho's command versus what she knew to be God's will. She chose to obey the higher law to preserve the lives of God's messengers. Her deception was in service of a greater truth and a greater allegiance.

**Faith Precedes Perfection**. The Bible consistently presents heroes of faith as flawed, complex people. God commends Rahab for her faith—her trust in Him that led to action—not for her perfection. Her act of welcoming and protecting the spies was the tangible evidence of her faith.

**God's Focus is the Heart**. God looked past her profession and her deception and saw a heart that believed in Him. He honored her faith, not her flawless execution.

*Dig Deeper*. When have you been caught between two conflicting obligations? How do you discern the *higher law* in such situations?

### Practical Application

**Use Your *Flax***. What ordinary resources, skills, or opportunities in your daily life could God use for an extraordinary purpose? (Your home for hospitality, your skills for service, your words for encouragement).

**Act Decisively**. Is there a situation where you know the right thing to do, but have been hesitating? Ask God for the courage to act decisively in faith this week.

*Transition*. Rahab’s actions were not a blind gamble; they were based on a deep conviction about who God is.

## 3. Convinced Heart & Bold Request

**Rahab’s actions were rooted in a firm belief in God's supreme authority, which moved her to seek salvation for her family.**

!!! quote "Joshua 2:10-14, BSB"

    **10** For we have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan, whom you devoted to destruction. **11** When we heard this, our hearts melted and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on earth below.
    
    **12** Now therefore, please swear to me by the LORD that, just as I have shown you kindness, you also will show kindness to my father’s house. Give me a sure sign **13** that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will deliver us from death.”
    
    **14** “Our lives for your lives!” the men agreed. “If you do not report our mission, we will show you kindness and faithfulness when the LORD gives us the land.”

### Context & Insights

Here, Rahab reveals the *why* behind her actions. She preaches a sermon to the spies! Her theology is surprisingly robust. She doesn't just know *about* the Israelites' victories; she knows *who* was behind them: Yahweh.

- *We have heard*. The stories of God's power were common knowledge. The Exodus and the victories over Sihon and Og were decades-old news, yet their impact was fresh.

- *The LORD your God is God in heaven above and on earth below*. This is the central confession of the Old Testament (cf. Deut. 4:39). A Canaanite prostitute, a pagan living in a doomed city, makes one of the most profound statements of faith in the Bible. She recognizes the God of Israel as the supreme, universal sovereign.

- *Give me a sure sign*. Her faith is not passive; it is active. It moves her to seek a secure promise—a covenant—of salvation. She doesn't just want to save herself; her concern extends to her entire family.

**Illustration**. Imagine someone today who has only heard about Christianity through news reports and cultural osmosis. Then, in a moment of crisis, they piece it all together and declare, *That Jesus everyone talks about—He's not just another religious figure. He is the Lord of everything*. And on the basis of that conviction, they seek out a Christian and say, *Tell me how to be saved*. This is what Rahab did.

!!! question "Great Confession"

    1. What is the significance of a Canaanite prostitute making this great confession about God's sovereignty?

#### Common Answers

**God's Grace is for Everyone**. It shows that salvation is not limited by ethnicity, social status, or past sins. God's call and grace extend to anyone who will believe, no matter how unlikely they seem.

**Faith Comes by Hearing**. It demonstrates the power of God's testimony. The stories of His mighty deeds are powerful enough to produce saving faith in a receptive heart (Romans 10:17).

**A Rebuke to Unbelief**. Rahab's faith stands in stark contrast to the unbelief of Israel in the wilderness, who saw God's works firsthand yet failed to trust Him. She had less evidence but greater faith.

*Dig Deeper*. Who are the *Rahabs* in our world today—the unlikely people whom God might be calling to Himself? How does our church welcome them?

!!! question "Faith for Family"

    2. Rahab's faith immediately extended to a desire for her family's salvation. What does this teach us about the nature of true saving faith?

#### Common Answers

**Faith is Not Selfish**. Genuine faith is not just about *me and Jesus*. It naturally overflows into a deep concern for the people we love.

**Faith Leads to Intercession**. A heart changed by God longs for others to experience the same grace. This leads to intercession, advocacy, and sharing the hope we have found.

*Dig Deeper*. Who is in your *father's house* that you need to be advocating for in prayer and action?

### Practical Application

**Verbalize Your Faith**. This week, find an opportunity to verbalize why you believe in God. It doesn't have to be a sermon; it could be a simple statement of trust in His goodness and power.

**Pray for Your Household**. Make a list of your family members (*your father's house*). Commit to praying specifically for their salvation or for the deepening of their faith every day this week.

*Transition*. A deal was struck, based on a promise. But a promise is only as good as the one who keeps it.

## 4. A Promise Kept, A Family Saved

**God honors courageous faith by ensuring that the promise of salvation is faithfully delivered.**

!!! quote "Joshua 6:22-25, BSB"

    **22** Meanwhile, Joshua told the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the house of the prostitute and bring out the woman and all who are with her, just as you promised her.” 
    
    **23** So the young spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out her whole family and settled them outside the camp of Israel.
    
    **24** Then the Israelites burned up the city and everything in it. However, they put the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD’s house.
    
    **25** And Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her father’s household and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho. So she has lived among the Israelites to this day.

### Context & Insights

The walls of Jericho have fallen. The battle is raging. In the midst of this chaos, Joshua remembers. He gives a specific command to ensure the promise made to Rahab is kept. The two spies, who made the oath, are the ones sent to fulfill it.

- *Joshua told the two men*. Joshua, the leader of the entire nation, takes personal responsibility for the oath made by his men. He shows integrity and honors the covenant.

- *Outside the camp of Israel*. Rahab and her family were ceremonially unclean as Gentiles. They were brought to a safe place *outside the camp* as an interim step before they could be fully integrated into the nation. This was an act of both separation and protection.

- *She has lived among the Israelites to this day*. This is the beautiful conclusion. Her salvation was not temporary. She was fully incorporated into the people of God. So much so, that this former Canaanite prostitute appears in the genealogy of Jesus Christ (Matthew 1:5).

**Illustration**. A firefighter, in the middle of a raging inferno, remembers a promise to a child to save their trapped pet. While other firefighters are battling the main blaze, he diverts to a specific room, finds the pet, and brings it out safely, because a promise is a promise, even in chaos. Joshua's focus on saving Rahab was just as intentional.

!!! question "Kept Promise"

    1. What does Joshua's carefulness to keep the promise to Rahab teach us about God's character?

#### Common Answers

**God is Faithful**. God takes oaths and promises seriously. Joshua's faithfulness is a reflection of God's own perfect faithfulness. When God makes a promise (like the promise of salvation), He will see it through, no matter the chaos.

**God Remembers the One**. In the midst of a massive military operation involving thousands of people, God's plan zooms in on one individual and her family. It shows His personal care and concern for each person who trusts in Him.

**God's Salvation is Complete**. Rahab was not just saved *from* death; she was saved *to* a new life, a new identity, and a place among God's people. God's salvation is always a complete rescue and a new beginning.

*Dig Deeper*. How does Rahab's inclusion in Jesus's genealogy (Matthew 1:5) serve as the ultimate confirmation of her salvation and God's grace?

### Practical Application

**Remember God's Faithfulness**. Reflect on a time when God kept a promise to you or showed His faithfulness in your life. Thank Him for it.

**Be a Promise Keeper**. Consider a promise you have made to someone. This week, take a specific step to fulfill that promise, reflecting God's own faithfulness.

## Closing

### Reflection

In a city paralyzed by fear, one woman acted in faith. Rahab heard the stories of God's power and believed them. She risked her life to align herself with God's people, she confessed His universal sovereignty, and she sought salvation not just for herself, but for her entire family. In return, God honored her faith, kept His promise, and grafted this Canaanite prostitute into the lineage of the Messiah. Her story is a powerful testament that faith is not a passive feeling; it is an active trust in God that courageously defies the culture of fear.

### Decision

**A**. City of Fear – What fear is paralyzing you, your family, or your community right now?

**B**. Act of Faith – What is one courageous action, however small, you can take this week to choose faith over that fear?

**C**. Confession of Faith – Are you willing to declare, like Rahab, that the LORD is "God in heaven above and on earth below," even when it's unpopular?

**D**. Promise of Salvation – Have you, like Rahab, secured a promise of salvation for you and your household by placing your trust in God's anointed one, Jesus?

### Challenges

#### 1. Pinpoint Your Fear.
Write down the primary fear that is influencing your decisions right now. Next to it, write down Rahab's confession: *[The LORD] is God in heaven above and on earth below*. Spend time in prayer, asking God to make His sovereignty more real to you than your fear.

#### 2. Scarlet Cord.
Rahab's signal was a scarlet cord. What is one visible, tangible action you can take this week that signals your faith to those around you? It could be an act of hospitality, a conversation about your faith, or a decision to trust God in a difficult circumstance.

#### 3. Pray for Your Household.
Identify your *father's house*—the family, friends, and loved ones you are concerned for. Like Rahab, intercede for them. Commit to praying for their protection and salvation every day for the next seven days.

#### 4. Memory Verse.
Memorize [Joshua 2:11b](https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-11.htm) this week—*...for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on earth below*. Use this confession as a weapon against fear and doubt.

### Prayer

> Heavenly Father, we stand in awe of Your power that can cause hearts to melt, and Your grace that can save the most unlikely people. We confess that, like the people of Jericho, we are often paralyzed by fear. Forgive us for letting the threats of this world loom larger than Your sovereignty.
> 
> Lord, we want to have the faith of Rahab—a faith that acts, a faith that speaks, a faith that saves. Give us the courage to hide the messengers of truth, to defy the expectations of our culture, and to boldly confess that You alone are God over all. Help us to seek salvation not only for ourselves but for our entire household.
> 
> Thank you for being a God who keeps His promises. Thank you for grafting us into Your family through the ultimate *scarlet cord*—the blood of Jesus. May our lives be a testament to Your saving grace. In the powerful name of Jesus, our Savior, Amen.
