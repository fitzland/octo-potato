### Introduction

#### Icebreaker

**Option A:** "When have you misjudged a book by its cover, either a person or a situation?"

**Option B:** "Who’s the most prideful character you recall from a book or movie? What was their downfall or turning point?"

*Sometimes, the most profound changes come from the most unexpected places. Today we'll look at the story of a powerful man whose life was turned upside down by an unlikely messenger and a command that challenged his pride.*

---

#### Core Message

The story of Naaman's healing is a powerful demonstration of God's sovereignty and grace. The central truth for us today is:

**God restores us as we are obedient to Him, and His methods often defy our expectations and humble our pride.**

### A Journey of Restoration

Naaman's path from a powerful commander with a debilitating disease to a restored man with a new faith unfolds in three key scenes.

> **Part 1: The Unlikely Hope**  
> **Part 2: The Test of Pride**  
> **Part 3: The Humble Restoration**

### Part 1: The Unlikely Hope (2 Kings 5:1-3)
**Hope arrives from the most unexpected source.**

!!! quote "2 Kings 5:1-3, BSB"

    **1** Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in his master’s sight and highly regarded, for through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. And he was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.

    **2** At this time the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken a young girl from the land of Israel, and she was serving Naaman’s wife.

    **3** She said to her mistress, “If only my master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would cure him of his leprosy.”

#### Context
Naaman was a man who had it all: power, prestige, and the king's favor. He was a "great man" and a "valiant warrior." The text even notes that the LORD had given Aram victory through him, a subtle reminder of God's sovereignty over all nations. Yet, despite his greatness, he had a secret weakness: a skin disease. This wasn't necessarily the modern Hansen's disease, but a condition that made him ritually unclean and was often seen as a divine judgment.

The hope for his healing comes not from a king or a great warrior, but from a nameless, young Israelite girl who had been captured in a raid and was now a servant in his house. She was, by all worldly standards, powerless. Yet, she held the key to Naaman's restoration.

#### The Unlikely Messenger
This story immediately shows us that God uses unlikely people for His purposes. He works through the small, the lowly, and the weak to accomplish His great plans. This young girl, in a foreign land and a position of servitude, still had faith in the God of Israel and His prophet. She didn't let her circumstances silence her witness.

This is a powerful reminder that God can use anyone, anywhere, at any time. We don't need a position of power or influence to be a part of God's restorative work in the world.

#### Discussion Questions
- When have you seen God work through an unlikely person?
- What might have prevented the servant girl from speaking up? What can we learn from her courage?

### Part 2: The Test of Pride (2 Kings 5:10-12)
**Naaman's expectations clash with God's simple command.**

!!! quote "2 Kings 5:10-12, BSB"

    **10** Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.”

    **11** But Naaman went away angry, saying, “I thought that he would surely come out, stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the spot to cure my leprosy.

    **12** Are not the Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.

#### Context
After the servant girl's suggestion, Naaman went to his king, who sent him to the king of Israel with a letter and lavish gifts. The king of Israel panicked, thinking it was a trap. Elisha intervened, telling the king to send Naaman to him, so that Naaman would "know that there is a prophet in Israel." Naaman arrived at Elisha's house with his horses and chariots, a full display of his power and importance.

#### The Clash
Naaman had a clear expectation of how this would go. He, a great man, expected a great show. He thought Elisha would come out personally, perform a dramatic ritual, and heal him on the spot. Instead, Elisha didn't even come out. He sent a messenger with a simple, almost insulting, command: "Go wash seven times in the Jordan."

Naaman's pride was wounded.
- **He was insulted:** Elisha didn't give him the personal attention his status demanded.
- **He was disappointed:** The cure was mundane, not magical.
- **He was offended:** He was told to wash in the muddy Jordan River, when the rivers of his homeland, Damascus, were far superior in his eyes.

His reaction was rage. Pride blinded him to the possibility that God's power could work through such simple means. He almost missed his miracle because it didn't fit his script.

#### Discussion Questions
- When have you seen pride get in the way of obedience?
- Why do we often prefer complex, dramatic solutions over simple, humble ones?

### Part 3: The Humble Restoration (2 Kings 5:14-17)
**Humility and obedience lead to complete restoration of body and soul.**

!!! quote "2 Kings 5:14-17, BSB"

    **14** So Naaman went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God. And his flesh was restored like that of a young boy, and he was clean.

    **15** Then Naaman and all his attendants returned to the man of God. He went and stood before Elisha and said, “Indeed, now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.”

    **16** But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will accept nothing.” And though Naaman urged him, Elisha refused.

    **17** “If you will not,” said Naaman, “please let me, your servant, be given as much soil as a pair of mules can carry. For your servant will never again make a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any other god but the LORD.

#### The Turning Point
Thankfully, Naaman's servants intervened. They wisely pointed out that if the prophet had asked him to do some "great thing," he would have done it. So why not do this simple thing? Naaman swallowed his pride, went down to the Jordan, and obeyed.

The result was immediate and complete. His skin was not just healed; it was "restored like that of a young boy." He was made clean.

#### The Transformation
The most profound restoration was not physical, but spiritual. Naaman returned to Elisha a changed man.
- **He confessed his faith:** "I know there’s no God in the whole world except in Israel." This is a radical confession from a pagan commander.
- **He offered a gift:** His gratitude overflowed, but Elisha refused the gift, making it clear that God's grace cannot be bought. It is a free gift.
- **He committed to worship:** He asked to take soil from Israel to build an altar to the LORD in his own land. His faith was now exclusive. He would worship the LORD alone.

Naaman's journey shows that obedience, rooted in humility, is the path to restoration. God didn't just heal his skin; He captured his heart.

#### Discussion Questions
- How has God used a challenging circumstance to bring about good in your life?
- What is the connection between obedience to God and humility?

### Application & Practical Living

Naaman's story is our story. We all have areas of brokenness and need God's restoration.

#### Three Practical Applications

##### 1. Review Your Obedience.
Take stock of your life. In what areas are you demonstrating obedience to God? Where are you struggling? Write down the ways you are obeying and the benefits you see. This practice strengthens your resolve to follow Him.

##### 2. Request God's Help with Pride.
Pride is a subtle and powerful barrier to obedience. Ask God in prayer to show you any areas where pride is preventing you from following Him. Choose one area and make it a matter of consistent prayer, asking for humility.

##### 3. Find an Accountability Partner.
Restoration often happens in community. Enlist a trusted Christian friend or mentor to hold you accountable in an area where you struggle with obedience. Give them permission to speak truthfully and lovingly into your life.

### Weekly Challenges

#### 1. The Obedience Audit (Reflection)
Prayerfully use the following checklist to consider your own heart of obedience. Mark the statements that are true for you.
- [ ] I have seen God at work in my life.
- [ ] When I need healing, I look to God with my hope and requests.
- [ ] I trust God’s sovereignty in life, death, sickness, and healing.
- [ ] When it’s clear God has given a command, I am willing to obey.
- [ ] From my heart, I want to obey God fully.
- [ ] Peace has come in my life as a result of obeying God.
Write a prayer asking God for strength to obey in the areas where you want to grow.

#### 2. The "Jordan River" Step (Action)
Identify one area where God is calling you to simple, humble obedience, but your pride or expectations are getting in the way. What is your "Jordan River"? Take a concrete step this week to swallow your pride and obey.

#### 3. The "Unlikely Messenger" Watch (Attitude)
Be on the lookout this week for how God might be speaking to you through unlikely people or circumstances. Ask God to give you a humble and listening heart.

### Extra Context & Background

#### Historical & Cultural Notes
- **Aram (Syria):** A powerful kingdom to the northeast of Israel, often in conflict with them. Damascus was its capital.
- **Skin Disease (*tsara'at*):** This Hebrew term covers a range of skin conditions. It was not just a medical issue but also a matter of ritual purity. A person with *tsara'at* was considered unclean and was isolated from the community.
- **The Jordan River:** Israel's main river, it was often muddy and unimpressive compared to the clear, fast-flowing rivers of Damascus like the Abana and Pharpar. This contrast highlights the humility required of Naaman.
- **Rimmon:** A storm god worshiped in Aram. Naaman's request to bow in the temple of Rimmon reflects the real-world tension of living out a new faith while still having duties in a pagan society. Elisha's response, "Go in peace," shows grace and understanding.

#### Theological Connections
- **God's Sovereignty:** The story shows that God is not a tribal deity. He is the sovereign Lord over all nations, using even enemy commanders for His purposes.
- **Humility before Grace:** Naaman's story is a perfect Old Testament illustration of the principle that "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble" ([`James 4:6`](https://biblehub.com/james/4-6.htm); [`1 Peter 5:5`](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm)).
- **Salvation by Grace, Not Works:** Elisha's refusal of Naaman's gift demonstrates that God's healing and restoration cannot be earned or purchased. It is a gift of grace, received through faith and obedience.

### Closing Reflection

God always responds positively to our obedience. Humble obedience sets the stage for God to do His greatest work: restoration. Naaman came seeking a cure for his skin, but he left with a new heart. He came as a proud warrior, but he left as a humble worshiper of the one true God.

It's unwise to demand that God work in a specific way or according to our expectations. All that does is set us up for disobedience and disappointment. Naaman's story is a powerful reminder that God's ways are not our ways. He uses the unlikely, commands the simple, and offers a restoration that is far deeper and more complete than we could ever imagine. All He asks is that we swallow our pride and obey.

### Closing Prayer

> Lord,
>
> Forgive us for the times we, like Naaman, have demanded that You work according to our expectations. Forgive us for our pride, which so often gets in the way of simple, humble obedience.
>
> Thank you for your grace, which reaches people we might consider enemies, and for your power, which works through the most unlikely people and circumstances. Help us to trust in Your wisdom to always do what is best for us.
>
> Give us the humility to "go and wash," to obey You in the simple things. We thank You for the promise of restoration that comes through obedience. Heal us, cleanse us, and make us new.
>
> In Jesus' name, Amen.
