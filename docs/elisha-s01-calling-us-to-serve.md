# God’s Hand in Calling Us to Serve

## 1 Kings 19:19-21 & 2 Kings 2:7-15

### The Point

God invites us to join Him in His work.

### Context

The events of 1 Kings 19 follow the climax of Elijah's ministry on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18), where he defeated the prophets of Baal. Following this victory, Queen Jezebel threatened his life, causing Elijah to flee into the wilderness to Mount Horeb. It is there that God, after speaking to the discouraged prophet, gives him three commands: anoint Hazael as king of Aram, Jehu as king of Israel, and Elisha as his own successor (1 Kings 19:9-18). Our first passage, the calling of Elisha, happens immediately after this divine encounter.

The second passage, from 2 Kings 2, takes place sometime later. Elisha has been faithfully serving as Elijah's attendant, and the time for Elijah's departure from the earth has arrived. As they travel from Gilgal toward the Jordan River, Elijah repeatedly urges Elisha to stay behind, but Elisha refuses to leave his master's side. Along the way, groups of prophets (the "sons of the prophets") confirm that the LORD is about to take Elijah, heightening the drama that culminates at the riverbank.

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

*   What’s the most interesting or important invitation you’ve ever received?
*   Think about the invitations you receive in a given week—junk mail, social media events, maybe even a jury summons. Which ones do you accept, and which do you ignore? Why?

### Illustration: The Unrefusable Offer

We are constantly bombarded with invitations. The local car dealership invites us to spend thousands on a new vehicle. A credit card company invites us to sign up for a new card with a low introductory rate. The county invites us to pay our property taxes on time. Most of these are easy to dismiss.

But what if you received a personal invitation from someone you deeply admire—a world leader, a brilliant artist, or a legendary athlete—to come and be their personal apprentice? What if they wanted to pour their life's work and wisdom into you? That's an invitation you wouldn't just consider; you would drop everything for it. It’s an unrefusable offer.

The call of Elisha is a story about that kind of offer. It’s about God’s invitation to join Him in His work. It’s not a piece of junk mail we can toss aside. It is a personal, life-altering summons from the Creator of the universe to be part of His redemptive plan. Today we'll see what it looks like to receive that invitation and, like Elisha, to give it the "yes" it deserves.

## Lesson Flow & Analysis

### Part 1: The Call & Total Commitment

> #### 📖 SCRIPTURE (1 Kings 19:19-21, BSB)
>
> **19** So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him. **20** Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. “Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye,” he said, “and then I will follow you.”
>
> “Go back,” Elijah replied. “What have I done to you?”
>
> **21** So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant.

#### Analysis

*   **The Mantle/Cloak:** This was more than a piece of clothing; it was a symbol of the prophet's authority and power. By throwing his cloak over Elisha, Elijah was obeying God's command to anoint Elisha as his successor (1 Kings 19:16). This act symbolized the transfer of the prophetic office. The secular phrase "pass the mantle" originates from this story.
*   **Elisha's Response:** Elisha's reaction is immediate and decisive. He leaves the oxen and runs after Elijah, showing his willingness.
*   **"Kiss my father and mother":** This was not a sign of reluctance but of realism. Elisha understood the gravity of the call and the life he was leaving behind. It was a formal goodbye to his family, security, and former life, echoing Abraham's call to leave his homeland (Gen. 12:1-3).
*   **Elijah's Reply - "What have I done to you?":** This rhetorical question was Elijah's way of clarifying the source of the call. He was making it clear that the call was from God, not from him. Elisha's ultimate service was to God, not to his mentor.
*   **Slaughtering the Oxen:** This was a dramatic and symbolic act. By slaughtering his oxen and burning his plowing equipment to cook the meat, Elisha was making a complete and irreversible break with his past. There was no going back. It was a public declaration of his "all-in" commitment. Jesus uses similar imagery about not looking back from the plow (Luke 9:62).
*   **The Feast:** Sharing the meat with the people was a communal act. In the ancient world, households were large, including extended family and servants. This feast was both a farewell and a joyful celebration of his new calling, blessing his community with the sacrifice.

#### Discussion

*   Who has been an example to you of obedience to God’s voice?
*   What are some things we might have to leave behind in order to join God in His work?
*   What obstacles can prevent us from responding to God’s leadership with all-in obedience?

### Part 2: The Request & Divine Ascent

> #### 📖 SCRIPTURE (2 Kings 2:7-11, BSB)
>
> **7** Fifty men from the sons of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped by the Jordan. **8** Then Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
>
> **9** When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken away from you?”
>
> “Please,” Elisha replied, “let me inherit a double portion of your spirit.”
>
> **10** “You have asked a difficult thing,” Elijah said. “Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours. But if not, it will not be so.”
>
> **11** As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.

#### Analysis

*   **The Sons of the Prophets:** These were not biological sons but members of a prophetic guild or community, likely studying under a senior prophet like Elijah. Their presence as witnesses is significant.
*   **Striking the Water:** This act directly echoes Moses parting the Red Sea (Exodus 14). It is a demonstration of God's power over nature, showing that the God of the Exodus is still at work. The cloak, like Moses' staff, is not a magical object but a symbol of God's authority working through His chosen prophet.
*   **"A double portion of your spirit":** This is the request of a firstborn son for his inheritance (Deut. 21:17). Elisha is not asking for twice Elijah's power, but to be recognized as his legitimate spiritual heir, equipped to carry on the ministry. He is asking for the same Spirit of God that empowered Elijah to rest on him so he can fulfill the prophetic office. This acknowledges a deep, father-son relationship between them.
*   **The Chariot and Horses of Fire:** Fire is a common symbol of God's presence and power. Chariots and horses were the ultimate symbols of military might in the ancient world. God's "army" of fire demonstrates His omnipotence and that He is the true power behind Israel.
*   **Ascension in a Whirlwind:** Elijah does not die; he is taken directly into God's presence. This is a profound statement of God's power over life and death. Furthermore, the Canaanite god Baal was worshiped as the "rider of the clouds" and a storm god. By taking Elijah in a whirlwind, God demonstrates His absolute supremacy over all false gods and the forces of nature.

#### Discussion

*   How has God’s presence made a difference as you’ve served Him?
*   What might be the consequences of trying to serve God apart from His presence?

### Part 3: The Confirmation & Public Affirmation

> #### 📖 SCRIPTURE (2 Kings 2:12-15, BSB)
>
> **12** Elisha saw this and cried out, “My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!” And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two.
>
> **13** He picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. **14** Then he took the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and struck the water. “Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?” he asked. And when he had struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over.
>
> **15** When the sons of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.

#### Analysis

*   **"My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!":** Elisha's cry makes the father-son relationship explicit. He verbally acknowledges that Elijah was the embodiment of Israel's true strength, which was God's power.
*   **Tearing Clothes:** This was a traditional sign of deep grief and mourning, seen in figures like Job and King Ahab. Elisha is grieving the loss of his beloved mentor and spiritual father.
*   **Picking up the Mantle:** This is the pivotal moment. By picking up the cloak that fell from Elijah, Elisha accepts the transfer of the prophetic role. He is literally and figuratively taking on the mantle of his master.
*   **"Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?":** This is not a cry of doubt, but a bold challenge and a prayer. It is a moment of truth. Elisha is publicly asking God to affirm his calling by showing the same power through him that was shown through Elijah.
*   **Parting the Water Again:** When the water parts for Elisha, it is God's unmistakable confirmation. The power of God that was with Elijah is now with Elisha.
*   **The Prophets' Recognition:** The "sons of the prophets," who were watching from a distance, see this miracle and immediately recognize the transfer of authority. Their statement, "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha," and their act of bowing down before him, serve as the public affirmation of Elisha's new role as God's prophet.

#### Discussion

*   What are some ways God reassures us of His presence and power?
*   How does God empower believers today to do His work?
*   What practical steps can we take to rely more on God’s power as we serve Him?

## Conclusion

Today we've seen one of the most dramatic succession stories in the Bible. Elisha’s call was not a quiet suggestion; it was a life-interrupting summons. His response was not hesitant; it was a decisive, all-in commitment that involved a burnt plow and a farewell feast. He then shadowed his mentor, refusing to leave his side, knowing that the power for the ministry ahead did not come from the mantle he would inherit, but from the God who was calling him.

Elisha’s story reminds us that God’s invitation to join Him is the most important one we will ever receive. It demands a response. It requires that we are willing to leave our own "plows" behind, to depend not on our own strength but on His, and to boldly ask for His presence as we step into the work He has for us. God is still extending that invitation today—in our families, in our workplaces, in our church, and in our communities. The question is, will we recognize His call, and how will we respond?

### Closing Prayer

Father, thank You for the privilege of being invited to join You in Your eternal work. We stand in awe of the story of Elijah and Elisha—of a call given, a commitment made, and power demonstrated.

We confess that we often cling to our own plans, our own comforts, our own plows. Forgive us for the times we have treated Your call like junk mail, to be ignored or set aside for a more convenient time. Give us the courage of Elisha to say "yes" without reservation, to burn what is behind us, and to follow You fully.

Lord, we ask for a double portion of Your Spirit—not for our own glory, but so that we can be equipped to do the work You have called us to. Help us to rely on Your power, not our own. Open our eyes to see where You are at work all around us and give us the faith to step into that work.

We commit ourselves to You anew today. Use us, empower us, and guide us, so that Your name might be glorified.

In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen.
