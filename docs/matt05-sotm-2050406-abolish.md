# Why would some think Jesus came to abolish the Law?

1.  **His Association with "Sinners":** Jesus regularly spent time with tax collectors, prostitutes, and others considered ritually unclean or morally outcast by the religious establishment (e.g., Matthew 9:10-13). To those obsessed with the boundary markers and separation aspects of the Law, this looked like He was disregarding God's commands about holiness and separation from sin. They might think, "If the Law was still important, why would he associate with *them*?"

2.  **His Actions Regarding the Sabbath:** Jesus performed healings on the Sabbath (e.g., Mark 3:1-6, Luke 13:10-17, John 5:1-18) and defended His disciples for picking grain on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:1-8). This directly clashed with the strict, human-made interpretations of Sabbath observance held by many Pharisees. His actions could easily be misinterpreted as disregarding the Fourth Commandment itself, rather than challenging their burdensome interpretations and asserting His Lordship over the Sabbath (Mark 2:27-28).

3.  **His Teaching on Purity and Food Laws:** Mark 7:1-23 is a prime example. Jesus declared that what goes *into* a person doesn't defile them, but what comes *out* of their heart does. Mark explicitly adds the parenthetical comment, "(Thus He declared all foods clean.)" (Mark 7:19 BSB). This was a radical statement that directly challenged the complex Levitical dietary laws. Someone hearing this could easily conclude He was throwing out that whole section of the Law.

4.  **His Emphasis on Grace, Mercy, and the Spirit of the Law:** Jesus focused heavily on love, mercy, forgiveness, and the internal condition of the heart (as seen in the Beatitudes just before this passage). Some might contrast this emphasis with the perceived strictness and judgment associated with the Law and assume He was replacing a system of law with a system purely of grace, thereby abolishing the former. They might miss that true fulfillment *involves* the heart transformation the Law pointed towards but couldn't achieve on its own.

5.  **His Critique of the Religious Leaders' Traditions:** Jesus frequently condemned the Pharisees and teachers of the Law for hypocrisy, for elevating their man-made traditions above God's commands, and for focusing on external minutiae while neglecting "the weightier matters of the lawâ€”justice, mercy, and faithfulness" (Matthew 23:23). Listeners could misinterpret His criticism of their *misuse* and *misinterpretation* of the Law as a rejection of the Law *itself*.

6.  **His Claim to Authority:** Jesus taught with an inherent authority ("But I say to you...") that seemed to place His word on par with, or even above, the interpretation of Moses (e.g., Matthew 5:21-48, the "antitheses" that follow our passage). To some, this might sound like He was replacing or overriding the Law given through Moses.

Essentially, Jesus' actions and teachings were so radical and focused on the heart and His own identity that they broke the existing molds of religious understanding. Those viewing Him through the lens of strict, external adherence to tradition could easily misunderstand His purpose, seeing His fulfillment *of* the Law's deeper intent as a destruction *of* the Law they knew. He needed to clarify: He wasn't tearing down the old structure; He was completing it and revealing its true foundation and purpose.
