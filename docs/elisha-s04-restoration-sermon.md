## Introduction: The Great Man with a Great Problem

We all have a tendency to judge a book by its cover. We see a successful person and assume their life is perfect. We see a powerful leader and assume they have it all together.

Today we meet a man like that. His name is Naaman. The Bible introduces him with an impressive resume: he is the commander of the entire Syrian army, a "great man" in the eyes of his king, highly regarded, a valiant warrior. He has power, prestige, and success.

But then the text gives us a six-word reality check: **"...but he was a leper."**

This great man had a great, secret problem. Leprosy in the ancient world was an incurable, isolating disease. It was a death sentence. All his power and wealth were useless against it.

This is a story for anyone who looks like they have it all together on the outside, but is privately battling a 'leprosy' of their own—a secret sin, a hidden addiction, a broken part of their life they can't fix.

Naaman's journey from desperation to restoration teaches us a profound truth: **God's methods for restoration often defy our expectations in order to humble our pride and reveal His grace.**

## 1. An Unlikely Hope (2 Kings 5:1-4)

> **1** Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man... but he was a leper. **2** ...the Arameans had... taken a young girl from the land of Israel, and she was serving Naaman’s wife. **3** She said to her mistress, “If only my master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would cure him of his leprosy.”

Hope for this powerful man did not come from a king, a general, or a wise advisor. It came from the most unlikely source imaginable: a young, nameless, captive Israelite slave girl in his own house. She was, by all worldly standards, powerless. Yet she held the key.

This young girl, ripped from her home, still had enough faith to believe that her God could do the impossible through His prophet. She is a powerful reminder that God often uses the small, the lowly, and the overlooked to accomplish His greatest plans.

[SPEAKER NOTE: Spend a minute explaining the power dynamic here. She was a captive from Israel, serving the wife of a commander from the very army that had destroyed her home. Her faith and compassion in this context are extraordinary.]

## 2. A Ridiculous Command (2 Kings 5:9-12)

So Naaman, desperate, gathers a fortune in gold and silver and travels to Israel. He shows up at the prophet Elisha's house with his horses and chariots, expecting a royal reception.

> **9** So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha's house. **10** Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.”
>
> **11** But Naaman went away angry, saying, “I thought that he would surely come out, stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the spot to cure my leprosy. **12** Are not the Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.

Naaman is furious. He is insulted. Elisha doesn't even come out to meet him! He just sends a messenger with a ridiculous command: "Go dip yourself in that muddy little Jordan River seven times."

Naaman had a script in his head for how this was supposed to work. He expected a performance, a magical incantation, something *great* and impressive. He was offered a simple, humiliating act of obedience. His pride couldn't handle it. He came ready to *buy* a miracle, but he was being asked to *receive* one for free, and the price was his pride.

This is the core of the story. So often, we want God to do something spectacular, something that makes sense to us. But God’s ways are not our ways. He chose a foolish method—a muddy river—to expose Naaman's pride.

[SPEAKER NOTE: Add a 3-4 minute personal story or illustration about a time you struggled with simple obedience because it felt 'beneath you' or didn't make sense. Why is it easier to do 'great things' for God than to simply obey in the small, daily things?]

## 3. A Complete Transformation (2 Kings 5:13-15)

Thankfully, Naaman's servants talk some sense into him. They say, "My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, 'Wash and be cleansed'?"

> **14** So Naaman went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God. And his flesh was restored like that of a young boy, and he was clean. **15** Then Naaman and all his attendants returned to the man of God... and said, “Indeed, now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel.”

Can you picture the scene? This proud warrior, swallowing his pride, stepping into that murky water.
*Dip one...* Nothing. Still leprous. He feels foolish.
*Dip two...* Still nothing. He feels angry.
*Dip three, four, five, six...* Still nothing. This is humiliating.
But he perseveres in obedience.
*Dip seven...* And his flesh is completely restored. New. Like a child's.

The deepest miracle wasn't the healing of his skin, but the transformation of his heart. He came back to Elisha a new man, not just physically clean, but spiritually converted. He declares that Israel's God is the *only* God. He came seeking a cure, but he left with a new Lord.

[SPEAKER NOTE: Spend time on the imagery of the seven dips. Build the tension. Emphasize that God could have healed him on the first dip, but the sevenfold command required complete, persistent, and humble obedience.]

## Conclusion & Application

Naaman's story is a beautiful picture of the Gospel. We all come to God with our 'leprosy'—our sin, our brokenness—that we cannot cure on our own. And God offers us a cure that seems foolish to the world. He doesn't ask us to do some "great thing." He asks us to humble ourselves, repent, and place our faith in Jesus Christ and His work on the cross.

Like Naaman, we have to let go of our pride. We have to be willing to obey the simple, and sometimes humiliating, command to trust in Christ alone.

What is the "Jordan River" God is calling you to today?
*   Is it a step of simple obedience you've been avoiding because it feels too small?
*   Is it a confession of a secret sin you've been trying to manage on your own?
*   Is it finally letting go of your pride and admitting you need a Savior?

God's restoration is on the other side of your seventh dip—that moment of complete, humble surrender. Don't let your pride keep you from being made clean.

[SPEAKER NOTE: For a brief, powerful closing, you can add the contrast of Gehazi here. "Naaman, the pagan outsider, leaves clean and worshiping God. But in the very next verses, Elisha's own servant, Gehazi, an insider, lets greed consume him and leaves covered in the very leprosy Naaman just escaped. Being near the power of God is not the same as being changed by it." This is an optional but sharp warning.]

## Closing Prayer

Father, we confess that we are often like Naaman. We come to you with our own expectations and our own pride, wanting you to work in ways that make us look good. Forgive us. Thank you for your free gift of grace that cannot be earned. Give us the humility to step into the Jordan River—to obey you in the simple, daily things. Heal our hidden leprosy, cleanse us from our sin, and restore us not just on the outside, but from the inside out. Make us new. In Jesus' name, Amen.
