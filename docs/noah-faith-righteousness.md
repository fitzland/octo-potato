# Living by Faith – Noah's Righteous Relationship
**Genesis 6:5-9, 17-22; 8:20-22 (BSB)**

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

**A**. When has a 'gut feeling' or an inner prompting led you to make a decision that went against the popular opinion or logic around you?

**B**. Describe a time you felt completely out of step with the prevailing culture, either in your beliefs or actions. What was that like?

*Sometimes, living by faith means walking a different path, even when it seems illogical to others*.

### Core Message

**Living by faith begins with a righteous relationship with God, characterized by His favor, our walk with Him, and complete obedience to His commands.**

### Lesson Flow

This lesson explores Noah's righteous relationship with God through four movements:

1.  [**The World's Wickedness & God's Grief**. Humanity's pervasive depravity grieves the Creator](#1-the-worlds-wickedness-gods-grief-genesis-65-7)
2.  [**Noah: A Righteous Exception**. God's grace sets Noah apart in a corrupt generation](#2-noah-a-righteous-exception-genesis-68-9)

Each movement highlights the profound impact of a righteous relationship with God amidst a fallen world.

## 1. The World's Wickedness & God's Grief (Genesis 6:5-7)
[<small>Back to Lesson Flow</small>](#lesson-flow)

**Humanity's pervasive depravity grieves the Creator.**

!!! quote "Genesis 6:5-7, BSB"

    **5** Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was altogether evil all the time. **6** And the LORD regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. **7** So the LORD said, “I will blot out man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—every man and beast and crawling creature and bird of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them.”

### Context & Insights

**A World Gone Astray**. Before the flood, humanity had reached an unparalleled depth of depravity. The text describes this wickedness as "great upon the earth," and more strikingly, that "every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was altogether evil all the time." This isn't just about actions; it's about the very source of human motivation—the heart and mind. This pervasive evil deeply grieved God.

??? info "Read More. God's Emotional Response"

    The phrase "the LORD regretted that He had made man" uses anthropopathic language, describing God in human terms to convey His deep emotional distress. This isn't God admitting a mistake, but expressing profound sorrow and heartbreak over humanity's persistent rebellion and the perversion of His good creation. It emphasizes God's personal investment in His creation and His righteous response to sin. His grief is not a weakness, but a profound aspect of His holy and loving character.

**Divine Grief and Judgment**. God's response to this wickedness was two-fold: profound grief and a resolute decision for judgment. He was "grieved in His heart," reflecting the deep pain of a loving Creator whose creation has turned completely against Him. This grief leads to the declaration to "blot out man." This is not capricious anger, but a just response to utter moral corruption, designed to purge evil from the earth.

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    What does it mean for "every inclination of the thoughts of his heart" to be "altogether evil all the time"? How might this manifest in a society today?

### Common Answers

**COMPLETE CORRUPTION**. Not just some bad actions, but the fundamental orientation of human desire and thought was against God.
- *Follow-up*. Are there modern trends that echo this level of moral decay, focusing purely on self-gratification or power?

**GOD'S HOLY RESPONSE**. God's grief is a sign of His holiness; He cannot tolerate sin, but He also feels deeply for His creation.
- *Follow-up*. How does seeing God's grief change our understanding of His judgment?

## 2. Noah: A Righteous Exception (Genesis 6:8-9)
[<small>Back to Lesson Flow</small>](#lesson-flow)

**God's grace sets Noah apart in a corrupt generation.**

!!! quote "Genesis 6:8-9, BSB"

    **8** Noah, however, found favor in the eyes of the LORD. **9** This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.

### Context & Insights

**Finding Favor**. In stark contrast to the universal condemnation, Noah "found favor in the eyes of the LORD." This is an act of divine grace; Noah didn't earn this favor, but received it. This divine favor was the foundation upon which his unique relationship with God was built and his salvation secured.

???+ note "Key Insight. Favor Precedes Righteousness"

    Noah's favor from God came *before* the description of his righteousness. This suggests that God's grace often initiates the relationship, enabling a person to then live righteously. It's not that Noah's righteousness earned favor, but that God's favor allowed him to be truly righteous in his context.

**A Righteous Man**. Noah is described as "a righteous man, blameless in his generation." This does not mean he was sinless, but that he was in right standing with God, acting justly and upholding God's standards in a world that had abandoned them. His blamelessness refers to his integrity and moral uprightness in the eyes of God.

**Walking with God**. The most profound statement about Noah's character is that he "walked with God." This phrase signifies an intimate, ongoing, and obedient relationship, marked by communion and trust. Like Enoch before him (Genesis 5:24), Noah lived in close fellowship with his Creator, allowing God's will to guide his life.

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    What does it practically mean to "walk with God" in our daily lives? How can we cultivate a deeper, more righteous relationship with Him in a world that often pulls us away?

### Common Answers

**INTIMATE FELLOWSHIP**. It means continuous communion, talking to God, listening for His guidance, and aligning our will with His.
- *Follow-up*. What are the biggest obstacles to maintaining this kind of "walk" in our busy, distracting lives?

**OBEDIENT LIVING**. Walking with God naturally leads to obeying His commands, even when unpopular or difficult.
- *Follow-up*. How does knowing God's omniscience (that He sees our every action, thought, and intention) motivate or challenge our desire for obedience?

## 3. God's Covenant & Noah's Obedience (Genesis 6:17-22)
[<small>Back to Lesson Flow</small>](#lesson-flow)

**God's plan for salvation demands Noah's complete trust and action.**

!!! quote "Genesis 6:17-22, BSB"

    **17** “Now behold, I Myself am bringing the flood of water upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which there is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall perish. **18** But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall enter the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. **19** And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. **20** Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every crawling thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you to keep them alive. **21** As for you, take for yourself some of every food that is edible, and gather it to yourself; and it shall be food for you and them.” **22** So Noah did these things; according to everything that God had commanded him, so he did.

### Context & Insights

**The Divine Plan**. God clearly states His intention to destroy "all flesh" with a flood, but immediately follows this with a declaration of grace: "But I will establish My covenant with you." This covenant is God's unilateral promise to preserve Noah and his family, and through them, all life. The means of preservation is the ark, which Noah is instructed to build.

**Detailed Instructions**. God gives Noah incredibly specific and comprehensive instructions regarding the ark's construction, the inhabitants (family and animals), and the provisions needed. This leaves no room for ambiguity or personal interpretation. The magnitude of the task is immense, requiring decades of labor and unwavering faith in an unseen future event.

??? info "Read More. The Ark: A Symbol of Salvation"

    The ark serves as a powerful symbol of salvation through divine provision. It is God's appointed means of deliverance from judgment, foreshadowing later biblical themes of rescue and redemption. Noah's act of entering the ark, despite the world's skepticism, demonstrates profound faith in God's word.

**Noah's Complete Obedience**. The passage culminates in a powerful statement: "So Noah did these things; according to everything that God had commanded him, so he did." This phrase emphasizes the absolute and unquestioning nature of Noah's obedience. He didn't pick and choose, he didn't negotiate, and he didn't deviate. His "walk with God" translated into perfect adherence to God's detailed commands, which ultimately saved his family and preserved life on earth.

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    How does Noah's complete obedience to God's seemingly impossible commands challenge our own understanding of faith and obedience today? What keeps us from such comprehensive obedience?

### Common Answers

**FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN**. It's hard to obey when we don't understand the full picture or the timeline.
- *Follow-up*. How can we cultivate trust in God's wisdom even when His commands seem counter-intuitive?

**LACK OF VISION**. Building an ark for a flood no one has seen requires immense foresight and belief in God's word.
- *Follow-up*. What "arks" might God be calling us to build today, demanding long-term commitment and faith in His promises?

## 4. Worship & God's Renewed Promise (Genesis 8:20-22)
[<small>Back to Lesson Flow</small>](#lesson-flow)

**Noah's post-flood devotion secures God's enduring grace.**

!!! quote "Genesis 8:20-22, BSB"

    **20** Then Noah built an an altar to the LORD. And taking from every kind of clean animal and clean bird, he offered burnt offerings on the altar. **21** When the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, He said in His heart, “Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from his youth. And never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done. **22** As long as the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall never cease.”

### Context & Insights

**An Altar of Gratitude**. The very first thing Noah does after leaving the ark and stepping onto dry ground is not to build a shelter or plant crops, but to build an altar to the LORD. This act of worship, offering burnt offerings from clean animals and birds, demonstrates profound gratitude, thanksgiving, and a renewed commitment to God. It signifies placing God first after such a monumental deliverance.

??? info "Read More. The Pleasing Aroma"

    The "pleasing aroma" refers to the acceptance of Noah's sacrifice by God. In the ancient Near East, sacrifices were often seen as a way to appease deities. Here, however, it represents God's gracious acceptance of Noah's worship and a reconciliation between God and humanity (represented by Noah). This sacrifice anticipates the ultimate perfect sacrifice of Christ.

**God's Renewed Promise**. In response to Noah's worship, God makes a solemn declaration "in His heart." He acknowledges that "every inclination of his heart is evil from his youth"—a continuation of the human condition identified in Genesis 6:5. Despite this enduring sinfulness, God resolves "Never again will I curse the ground because of man, and never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done." He then establishes the stability of the natural order: "seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall never cease."

**Enduring Grace**. This declaration is a testament to God's enduring grace and patience. Even though humanity's sinful nature remains, God commits to a different mode of interaction, promising stability and the preservation of life. This demonstrates His long-suffering love and His commitment to His creation, paving the way for future redemptive acts.

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    How should God's enduring grace, extended even in the face of our continued sinfulness, influence our daily lives and our motivation for righteous living?

### Common Answers

**HUMILITY AND GRATITUDE**. It should lead to deep humility that God's grace is not dependent on our perfection, and profound gratitude for His sustaining hand.
- *Follow-up*. How can we cultivate a habit of immediate worship and gratitude, like Noah's, even for God's "ordinary" provisions?

**MOTIVATION FOR HOLINESS**. God's grace doesn't negate the call to holiness; it empowers it. Knowing He is patient motivates us to strive for righteousness out of love.
- *Follow-up*. If God knows our hearts are continually inclined to evil, how does that shape our prayers for ourselves and our world?

## Closing

### Reflection
> In a world drowning in wickedness, Noah's righteous relationship with God shone like a beacon. He found favor, walked intimately with his Creator, and demonstrated complete obedience, leading to his salvation and the preservation of life. Even after judgment, his first act was worship, eliciting God's enduring promise of grace. Our God responds to our relationship with Him—with judgment for the unrepentant, and with grace, covenant, and enduring patience for those who, like Noah, live by faith.

### Decision

Right now, consider which aspect of Noah's story resonates most deeply with your own walk of faith:

**A. The World's Wickedness**. Are you acutely aware of the pervasive sin around you (and within you), and God's just response to it? What grief might God feel over your own heart?

**B. Noah's Righteous Walk**. Are you actively cultivating an intimate, obedient relationship with God, even if it makes you counter-cultural? What does "walking with God" look like for you this week?

**C. Noah's Complete Obedience**. Is there an "ark" God is calling you to build—a seemingly illogical but divinely commanded act of faith—that requires your unwavering trust and obedience?

**D. Noah's Post-Deliverance Worship**. Do you prioritize worship and gratitude after God's acts of grace in your life, reaffirming your commitment to Him? How can your life be a "pleasing aroma" to God?

## Prayer

> Sovereign God, we confess that the inclinations of our hearts are often evil, and we grieve with You over the sin in the world. Thank You for Your profound grace that allows us to find favor in Your eyes, not because of our merit, but because of Your love. Help us to be like Noah, to walk with You intimately and to obey Your commands completely, trusting in Your wisdom even when the path is unclear. May our lives be an offering of worship, and may we rest in Your faithful promises, knowing that You are always working for our good and Your glory. In Jesus' name, Amen.

## Weekly Challenges

### 1. Heart Check Challenge (Reflection)
For one day this week, consciously pay attention to your thoughts and intentions. Note any patterns of self-centeredness, judgment, or unrighteousness. Confess them to God and ask for His grace to align your inner world with His.

### 2. Ark Building Challenge (Action)
Identify one area where God is asking you to take a counter-cultural step of obedience or faith, even if it seems "illogical" to those around you. Take a concrete step towards building your "ark" this week, trusting God's command over human reason.

### 3. Post-Deliverance Worship Challenge (Attitude + Action)
Reflect on a recent time God delivered you from a difficult situation or provided for a need. This week, dedicate a specific time to offer Him focused, heartfelt worship and gratitude for that specific act of grace, beyond just a quick "thank you." Let your first response be an "altar" of praise.
