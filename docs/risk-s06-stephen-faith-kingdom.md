# Stephen. The Risk of Spirit-Led Service
**Acts 6:3-15**, BSB

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

**A**. Describe a time you took on a seemingly "small" or administrative task, but discovered it had a much larger or more significant impact than you initially expected.

**B**. When have you seen someone's character shine brightest, not during a moment of success, but during a moment of intense pressure or unfair criticism?

*Sometimes, God calls us to serve in ways that appear ordinary, only to unleash extraordinary impact and unexpected opposition.*

### Core Message

**Faithful service, empowered by the Spirit and wisdom, will lead to both divine fruitfulness and fierce opposition, revealing God's presence in the midst of risk.**

### Lesson Flow

Stephen's journey reveals how God uses faithful service for powerful witness:

2.  [**Divine Impact & Growth**. The word of God spreads powerfully](#2-divine-impact-and-growth-acts-67)
3.  [**Unstoppable Wisdom & Fierce Opposition**. Stephen's ministry beyond the tables](#3-unstoppable-wisdom-and-fierce-opposition-acts-68-15)

## 1. Choosing Spirit-Filled Servants (Acts 6:3-6)
[<small>Back to Lesson Flow</small>](#lesson-flow)

**The early church wisely selects Spirit-filled leaders for practical service.**

!!! quote "Acts 6:3-6, BSB"

    **3** Brothers, therefore, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task. **4** But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”
    
    **5** This proposal pleased the whole group. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, along with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. **6** They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.

### Context & Insights

The early church faced a growing problem: the Hellenist (Greek-speaking) widows felt neglected in the daily food distribution compared to the Hebraic (Aramaic-speaking) widows. This was a critical administrative issue threatening unity. The apostles, wisely prioritizing prayer and the ministry of the Word, proposed a solution: select seven qualified men. The criteria were not merely organizational skill, but profound spiritual character: "good reputation, full of the Spirit and wisdom." Stephen, notably described as "full of faith and the Holy Spirit," was among the chosen. This established a vital pattern for church leadership: practical service is a spiritual ministry requiring spiritual empowerment.

??? info "Linguistics. Men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and wisdom"

    Greek: *andraς martyroumenous hepta plēreis pneumatos kai sophias*. These qualifications highlight the holistic nature of leadership. "Good reputation" (*martyroumenos*) speaks to their established character and integrity within the community. "Full of the Spirit and wisdom" indicates that divine anointing and practical insight are essential for effective ministry, even in seemingly administrative roles.

??? info "Linguistics. Serving tables (diakonein trapezais)"

    This phrase is the origin of our word "deacon." It refers to the practical administration of food distribution to the needy. This text elevates practical service, demonstrating that it is a spiritual calling worthy of Spirit-filled leaders, not a lesser task.

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    1. The church needed practical help, but the apostles insisted on selecting men "full of the Spirit and wisdom." Why are these spiritual qualities essential for even administrative or "behind-the-scenes" roles in the church or any organization?

#### Common Answers

**Spiritual Perspective**: Spirit-filled leaders can approach practical problems with divine insight and a kingdom mindset, beyond mere efficiency.

**Unity & Peace**: Wisdom from the Spirit helps navigate interpersonal conflicts and maintain unity, preventing practical issues from becoming spiritual divisions.

**God's Glory**: Even mundane tasks can be done in a way that honors God and reflects His character when performed by Spirit-led individuals.

*Dig Deeper*. How might approaching your own daily tasks with a "full of the Spirit and wisdom" mindset transform your work, family, or volunteer activities?

### Practical Application

**Elevating the "Small" Task.** Reflect on a routine responsibility you have that you consider "small" or administrative. How can you intentionally approach it this week with Spirit-led wisdom and a desire to serve God, transforming it into a moment of worship or blessing?

**Character Cultivation.** Identify one of the qualities listed for Stephen (good reputation, full of faith, Holy Spirit, wisdom). What concrete step can you take this week to intentionally grow in that particular quality?

## 2. Divine Impact & Growth (Acts 6:7)
[<small>Back to Lesson Flow</small>](#lesson-flow)

**Effective leadership and holistic ministry result in powerful church expansion.**

!!! quote "Acts 6:7, BSB"

    **7** So the word of God spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased significantly. And a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.

### Context & Insights

Verse 7 serves as a powerful summary and bridge, highlighting the immediate and dramatic result of the apostles' wise decision and the Spirit-filled service of the seven. When practical needs are met and leaders are empowered, the "word of God spread" and the church experienced explosive growth. Significantly, "a large number of priests became obedient to the faith"—a remarkable detail, given their conservative nature and entrenched positions, underscoring the profound impact of the early church's Spirit-led ministry. This demonstrates that effective, holistic ministry leads to God's blessing and kingdom expansion.

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    1. This verse highlights both numerical growth and the conversion of priests. What does it tell us about the power of Spirit-led, holistic ministry to overcome barriers and reach unexpected groups?

#### Common Answers

**Authenticity Sells**: When the church demonstrates genuine care and spiritual power, it attracts even the most skeptical or entrenched individuals.

**Holistic Witness**: Meeting practical needs (serving tables) alongside spiritual teaching (ministry of the Word) creates a powerful, undeniable witness.

**God's Sovereignty**: Ultimately, God is at work, using faithful servants to break through societal and religious barriers that seem impossible.

*Dig Deeper*. What "unexpected groups" or individuals in our community might be reached if our church prioritizes both Spirit-filled service and powerful proclamation?

### Practical Application

**Identify a Barrier.** Consider a group or individual you believe is difficult to reach with the Gospel. Prayerfully ask God to show you how a "holistic" approach—combining practical service with Spirit-led witness—might break through that barrier this week.

**Celebrate Small Victories.** Notice and celebrate instances this week where you see God's Word spreading or someone's heart softened, even in seemingly small ways. These are fruits of Spirit-led ministry.

## 3. Unstoppable Wisdom & Fierce Opposition (Acts 6:8-15)
[<small>Back to Lesson Flow</small>](#lesson-flow)

**Stephen's powerful, Spirit-led witness ignites both divine wonders and intense persecution.**

!!! quote "Acts 6:8-15, BSB"

    **8** Now Stephen, full of grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. **9** But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freemen (as well as some of Cyrene and Alexandria, and some from Cilicia and Asia) rose up and began to dispute with Stephen. **10** Yet they were unable to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by whom he spoke.
    
    **11** Then they secretly induced men to say, “We heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.” **12** So they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes. They came and seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin. **13** They presented false witnesses who declared, “This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the Law. **14** For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses delivered to us.” **15** And everyone who was sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen and saw that his face was like the face of an angel.

### Context & Insights

Stephen, though initially chosen for "serving tables," quickly demonstrated a powerful ministry of proclamation, "full of grace and power," performing "great wonders and signs." His Spirit-filled wisdom was so compelling that his Jewish opponents from various synagogues could not refute him. Frustrated, they resorted to stirring up the crowds and bringing false witnesses who accused Stephen of blasphemy against Moses, God, the Temple, and the Law—accusations remarkably similar to those leveled against Jesus. Despite the grave danger, Stephen remained serene; his face glowed "like the face of an angel," a divine affirmation of his innocence and God's presence with him, even as he stood before the highest Jewish court.

??? info "Linguistics. Full of grace and power (plērēs charitos kai dynameōs)"

    This description echoes language used for Jesus (Luke 2:40, 52). It signifies that Stephen was not just a capable administrator but deeply anointed by God, enabling him to perform miracles and speak with divine authority. Grace is God's enabling favor; power is the supernatural ability it bestows.

??? info "Linguistics. Wisdom and the Spirit by whom he spoke (sophia kai tō pneumati hō elalei)"

    This is a direct fulfillment of Jesus' promise to His disciples that the Holy Spirit would give them the words and wisdom when they faced persecution (Luke 21:15). Stephen's opponents couldn't argue against him because his words were divinely inspired and irrefutable.

??? info "Cross-Reference. False Accusations"

    The false accusations against Stephen (speaking against God, Moses, the Temple, and the Law) directly parallel the charges brought against Jesus Himself (Matthew 26:59-61, Mark 14:57-58). This demonstrates a pattern: faithful witness to Christ often incurs the same opposition Christ faced, aligning the suffering of the disciple with that of the Master.

??? info "Cross-Reference. Face like the face of an angel"

    This visual detail emphasizes Stephen's divine affirmation and the unusual peace he possessed under intense pressure. It recalls Moses' radiant face after encountering God on Mount Sinai (Exodus 34:29-35), signifying God's intimate presence with Stephen in that moment.

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    1. Stephen's powerful witness, filled with wisdom and the Spirit, led directly to fierce opposition and false accusations. When has speaking truth in your life led to unexpected resistance or misunderstanding?

#### Common Answers

**Social Pressure**: Standing up for Christian values in a secular environment (work, school, social media).

**Family Dynamics**: Sharing faith with resistant family members, or challenging ungodly family patterns.

**Church Conflicts**: Advocating for biblical truth or unity within the church, facing pushback from entrenched views.

*Dig Deeper*. How do you typically react to such opposition? Does it silence you, or does it, like Stephen, embolden you?

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    2. Stephen's "face like the face of an angel" suggests a supernatural peace and presence of God amidst false accusations. How can we cultivate such a countenance when we face unfair criticism or persecution for our faith?

#### Common Answers

**Deep Trust in God**: Resting in God's sovereignty and justice, rather than relying on our own ability to defend ourselves.

**Spirit-Filled Prayer**: Communing with the Holy Spirit before, during, and after moments of conflict, seeking His peace and wisdom.

**Focus on Christ**: Shifting our focus from the accusers or the injustice to the glory of God and the example of Jesus.

*Dig Deeper*. Who in your life could benefit from seeing an "angelic countenance" (peace, grace, integrity) in you during a moment of pressure this week?

### Practical Application

**Speak Truth, Risk Opposition.** Identify one area where you know God wants you to speak a truth that might be unpopular or challenging. Prayerfully ask for the wisdom and courage to speak it with grace this week, trusting the Spirit to empower your words and accept the potential risk of opposition.

**Cultivate Calm Under Pressure.** This week, choose to intentionally seek God's presence and peace *before* responding to any situation of unfair criticism, misrepresentation, or conflict. Practice responding with integrity and a quiet spirit, rather than immediate defensiveness.

## Supplementary Content

### Historical & Cultural Context

**Synagogue of the Freemen (v. 9)**. This synagogue likely consisted of Jewish freedmen who had been enslaved and then released, often from various diaspora cities like Cyrene, Alexandria, Cilicia, and Asia. Having experienced slavery and now freedom, they might have been particularly zealous for their Jewish identity and traditions, making them resistant to Stephen's message about Jesus and the changing nature of the Law and Temple.

**The Sanhedrin (v. 12)**. The highest Jewish judicial and administrative council in Jerusalem, composed of 71 members (chief priests, elders, scribes). It was the same body that condemned Jesus. Being brought before them was a grave matter, often leading to severe punishment.

**Blasphemy and the Law (vv. 11-14)**. Accusations of blasphemy were among the most serious charges in Judaism, punishable by death (Leviticus 24:16). Speaking against Moses (representing the Torah) or the Temple (the center of Jewish worship and God's dwelling place) was seen as an attack on the core of their faith. These accusations were carefully crafted to rally public and religious support against Stephen.

### Theological Connections

**Divine Sovereignty in Selection**. God often chooses unexpected individuals for significant roles. Stephen, selected for practical administration, becomes a powerful proclaimer, demonstrating that God's Spirit equips for all forms of ministry.

**Cost of Discipleship**. Stephen's experience highlights that following Christ often involves suffering and persecution, mirroring Jesus' own life and teachings (Matthew 10:22, John 15:20). Taking risks for God is inherent to discipleship.

**Continuity and Discontinuity of the Law and Temple**. Stephen's "blasphemy" foreshadows a deeper theological truth: that while the Law and Temple were divinely ordained, they were ultimately temporary and pointed to Jesus, who is the fulfillment of both. God's presence is not confined to a building (Acts 7:48).

**Spirit-Empowered Witness**. The Holy Spirit is central to effective witness, providing wisdom, power, and courage, enabling believers to stand firm and speak boldly in the face of opposition.

**God's Presence in Suffering**. Stephen's radiant face and later vision (Acts 7:55-56) assure us that God is intimately present with His faithful servants even in their most challenging and dangerous moments.

## Closing

### Reflection
> Stephen's story reminds us that Spirit-led service extends beyond quiet administration to courageous witness, often incurring the wrath of those resistant to God's truth. His life calls us to embrace the risk of faithful obedience, knowing that even in the fiercest opposition, God's grace empowers us and His presence shines through us.

### Decision

As you reflect on Stephen's example, consider which of these postures best describes where you are:

**A**. **The Diligent Servant**. You're faithfully serving in a practical role, but perhaps haven't considered the potential for greater Spirit-led impact or the associated risks. Will you ask God to expand your vision?

**B**. **The Confronted Witness**. You've experienced pushback or criticism for your faith, and it has perhaps silenced or discouraged you. Will you risk being re-empowered by the Spirit to speak truth with wisdom again?

**C**. **The Hesitant Onlooker**. You see the need for bold witness but are fearful of the potential opposition. Will you risk stepping out in faith, trusting God's promise to be with you?

### Weekly Challenges

#### 1. Elevate the Ordinary Challenge.
Identify one "ordinary" or seemingly administrative task you regularly do (at home, work, or church) that you typically approach with minimal spiritual intentionality. This week, commit to performing that task "full of the Spirit and wisdom," praying over it, and seeking to serve God and others through it. Reflect on how your attitude and the outcome of the task might change.

#### 2. Spirit-Led Witness Challenge.
Ask the Holy Spirit to give you an opportunity this week to speak a truth (about your faith, a biblical principle, or an ethical stance) that might be unpopular or challenge someone's perspective, but is delivered with grace and wisdom. Reflect on your courage (or lack thereof) and the Spirit's leading. How did the conversation unfold?

#### 3. Pressure Test Character Challenge.
This week, when you encounter a situation of unfair criticism, misunderstanding, or pressure (either in person or online), consciously choose to respond with grace and integrity, rather than defensiveness or anger. Pray for an "angelic countenance." How did you feel? What was the impact of your Spirit-led response on yourself and those around you?

#### 4. Risk Assessment Prayer Challenge.
Stephen's ministry took him from serving tables to facing the Sanhedrin. Prayerfully ask God to reveal to you any specific area of your life where He is calling you to take a "risk" for the sake of the Gospel – perhaps by stepping out in faith, challenging a norm, or serving in a new way – even if it means potential opposition. What small step can you take this week to begin to act on that prompting?

### Prayer

> Heavenly Father, we thank You for the inspiring example of Stephen, a man full of Your Spirit and wisdom. We confess that too often we distinguish between "small" and "great" tasks, forgetting that all service, when done for Your glory, is sacred. Forgive us for our fears that keep us silent when we should speak, and for our defensiveness when confronted with opposition.

> We pray that You would fill us with Your grace and power, just as You filled Stephen. Help us to serve faithfully in every role You give us, whether at tables or in public witness, always seeking to honor You. Grant us courage to speak Your truth with wisdom, even when it leads to opposition, trusting that Your presence will sustain us and Your Spirit will speak through us. May our character shine brightly under pressure, reflecting Your glory to a watching world.

> Empower us, Lord, to embrace the risks of obedience, knowing that true fruitfulness often comes through faithfully enduring opposition. May we live in such a way that our lives bring You honor, and may Your kingdom advance through our Spirit-led service and bold witness. In Jesus' mighty name we pray. Amen.
