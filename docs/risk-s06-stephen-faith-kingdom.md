# Stephen. Faith that Advances the Kingdom
Acts 6:3-15, BSB

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

**A**. Describe a time you took on a seemingly *small* or administrative task, but discovered it had a much larger or more significant impact than you initially expected.

*Sometimes, God calls us to serve in ways that appear ordinary, only to unleash extraordinary impact and unexpected opposition.*

### Core Message

Bold faith, expressed through Spirit-filled service and witness, advances God's kingdom by producing divine fruitfulness even in the face of fierce opposition.

### Lesson Flow

Stephen's journey reveals how God uses faithful service for powerful witness:

1.  [**Choosing Spirit-Filled Servants**. Equipping for administrative needs](#1-choosing-spirit-filled-servants-acts-63-6)
2.  [**Divine Impact & Growth**. The word of God spreads powerfully](#2-divine-impact-and-growth-acts-67)
3.  [**Unstoppable Wisdom & Fierce Opposition**. Stephen's ministry beyond the tables](#3-unstoppable-wisdom-and-fierce-opposition-acts-68-15)

## 1. Choosing Spirit-Filled Servants (Acts 6:3-6)

**The early church wisely selects Spirit-filled leaders for practical service.**

### Acts 6:3-6, BSB

> **3** Brothers, therefore, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task. **4** But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”
>
> **5** This proposal pleased the whole group. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, along with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. **6** They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.

### Context & Insights

The early church faced a growing problem: the Hellenist (Greek-speaking) widows felt neglected in the daily food distribution. This administrative issue threatened unity. The apostles, prioritizing prayer and the ministry of the Word, proposed selecting seven qualified men. The criteria were not merely organizational, but profoundly spiritual: "good reputation, full of the Spirit and wisdom." Stephen, "a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit," was chosen. This established a vital pattern: practical service is a spiritual ministry requiring spiritual empowerment, and it often serves as the launchpad for a much wider, kingdom-advancing impact.

- **Spiritual & Reputable (v. 3)**. The qualifications—"good reputation" (*martyroumenos*) and "full of the Spirit and wisdom" (*plēreis pneumatos kai sophias*)—highlight that even practical ministry requires deep spiritual character.

- **Serving Tables (v. 2)**. The task was *diakonein trapezais*, from which we get the word "deacon." The text elevates this practical administration, demonstrating it is a spiritual calling worthy of Spirit-filled leaders.

### The Foundation of Service
> The church needed practical help, but the apostles insisted on selecting men "full of the Spirit and wisdom." Why are these spiritual qualities the essential foundation for any role that seeks to advance God's kingdom, even seemingly "administrative" ones?

#### Common Answers

**Spiritual Perspective**: Spirit-filled leaders can approach practical problems with divine insight and a kingdom mindset, beyond mere efficiency.

**Unity & Peace**: Wisdom from the Spirit helps navigate interpersonal conflicts and maintain unity, preventing practical issues from becoming spiritual divisions.

**God's Glory**: Even mundane tasks can be done in a way that honors God and reflects His character when performed by Spirit-led individuals.

### Reflection (Heart)

> How might approaching your own daily tasks (at work, home, or church) with a "full of the Spirit and wisdom" mindset transform them from simple duties into opportunities for kingdom impact?

## 2. Divine Impact & Growth (Acts 6:7)

**Effective leadership and holistic ministry result in powerful church expansion.**

### Acts 6:7, BSB

> **7** So the word of God spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased significantly. And a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.

### Context & Insights

Verse 7 serves as a powerful summary and bridge, highlighting the immediate and dramatic result of the apostles' wise decision and the Spirit-filled service of the seven. When practical needs are met and leaders are empowered, the "word of God spread" and the church experienced explosive growth. Significantly, "a large number of priests became obedient to the faith"—a remarkable detail, given their conservative nature and entrenched positions, underscoring the profound impact of the early church's Spirit-led ministry. This demonstrates that effective, holistic ministry leads to God's blessing and kingdom expansion.

### Advancing the Kingdom
> This verse highlights both numerical growth ("disciples... increased significantly") and the conversion of priests. What does this tell us about how bold, Spirit-led ministry advances the kingdom by overcoming social and religious barriers?

#### Common Answers

**Authenticity Sells**: When the church demonstrates genuine care and spiritual power, it attracts even the most skeptical or entrenched individuals.

**Holistic Witness**: Meeting practical needs (serving tables) alongside spiritual teaching (ministry of the Word) creates a powerful, undeniable witness.

**God's Sovereignty**: Ultimately, God is at work, using faithful servants to break through societal and religious barriers that seem impossible.

### Reflection (Heart)

> What "unexpected groups" or individuals in our community do we consider "hard to reach"? What would it look like for us to apply this same holistic approach (practical service + bold witness) to advance the kingdom among them?

## 3. Unstoppable Wisdom & Fierce Opposition (Acts 6:8-15)

**Stephen's powerful, Spirit-led witness ignites both divine wonders and intense persecution.**

### Acts 6:8-15, BSB

> **8** Now Stephen, full of grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. **9** But some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freemen (as well as some of Cyrene and Alexandria, and some from Cilicia and Asia) rose up and began to dispute with Stephen. **10** Yet they were unable to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by whom he spoke.
>
> **11** Then they secretly induced men to say, “We heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.” **12** So they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes. They came and seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin. **13** They presented false witnesses who declared, “This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the Law. **14** For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses delivered to us.” **15** And everyone who was sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen and saw that his face was like the face of an angel.

### Context & Insights

Stephen, though initially chosen for "serving tables," quickly demonstrated a powerful ministry of proclamation, "full of grace and power," performing "great wonders and signs." His Spirit-filled wisdom was so compelling that his Jewish opponents from various synagogues could not refute him. Frustrated, they resorted to stirring up the crowds and bringing false witnesses who accused Stephen of blasphemy—a direct reaction to a faith that was effectively advancing God's kingdom and threatening the status quo. Despite the grave danger, Stephen remained serene; his face glowed "like the face of an angel," a divine affirmation of his innocence and God's presence with him, even as he stood before the highest Jewish court.

- **Grace and Power (v. 8)**. This description (*plērēs charitos kai dynameōs*) echoes language used for Jesus, signifying Stephen was deeply anointed by God to speak and act with supernatural authority.

- **Unstoppable Wisdom (v. 10)**. His Spirit-filled speech fulfilled Jesus's promise that believers would be given words to say when facing persecution (Luke 21:15).

- **Echoes of Jesus (vv. 11-14)**. The false accusations against Stephen (blasphemy against God, Moses, the Temple, and the Law) directly parallel the charges brought against Jesus, showing that the disciple's suffering often mirrors the Master's.

- **Angelic Face (v. 15)**. This detail recalls the radiance of Moses after encountering God (Exodus 34:29-35), signifying God's intimate presence and peace with Stephen even while under intense pressure.

### The Cost of Boldness

> 1. Stephen's Spirit-filled wisdom was so effective that his opponents couldn't refute him and resorted to slander. When has speaking truth (at work, in your family, or in the community) led to unexpected resistance or misunderstanding?
>
> 2. Stephen's "face like the face of an angel" suggests a supernatural peace even while under attack. How can we cultivate a character that relies on God's presence for peace instead of reacting with fear or anger when our faith is challenged?

### Reflection (Heart)

> Think about your typical reaction when you face opposition for your beliefs. Does it tend to silence you, or does it, like Stephen, embolden you? What one thing could help you lean more on the Spirit's power in those moments?


## Closing

### Reflection
> Stephen's story is a powerful reminder that a bold faith advances God's kingdom. His life shows that Spirit-led service, even when it starts in ordinary ways, can lead to an extraordinary and unstoppable witness. It calls us to embrace the risk of faithful obedience, knowing that even in the fiercest opposition, God's grace empowers us and His presence shines through us.

### Decision (Will)
> Stephen's faith was not passive; it was active and bold. As you consider his example, what is your next step of faith?
>
> - **Will you embrace the small start?** Like Stephen, are you willing to serve faithfully in the "ordinary" roles, trusting God to use them as a launchpad for kingdom impact?
> - **Will you reclaim your voice?** If opposition has silenced you, will you ask the Spirit to re-empower you to speak truth with wisdom and courage once again?
> - **Will you take the first risk?** If you have been hesitant on the sidelines, will you trust God and take one concrete step of faith to advance His kingdom, even if it feels risky?

### Challenges (Practice)

**1. Elevate the Ordinary.** This week, choose one "ordinary" task you do and commit to performing it "full of the Spirit and wisdom." Pray over it and intentionally seek to serve God and others through it, viewing it as an opportunity for kingdom work.

**2. Speak with Wisdom.** Ask the Holy Spirit for one opportunity this week to speak a necessary truth with grace and wisdom, even if it might be unpopular. Trust Him to empower your words and prepare the hearts of those who hear.

**3. Cultivate Calm Under Pressure.** The next time you face unfair criticism or pressure, take a breath and consciously seek God's peace before you respond. Practice responding with a quiet spirit of integrity rather than immediate defensiveness.

**4. Memory Verse.** Acts 6:10 (BSB): "Yet they were unable to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by whom he spoke."

### Prayer

> Heavenly Father, we thank You for the inspiring example of Stephen, a man full of Your Spirit and wisdom. We confess that too often we distinguish between "small" and "great" tasks, forgetting that all service, when done for Your glory, is sacred. Forgive us for our fears that keep us silent when we should speak, and for our defensiveness when confronted with opposition.

> We pray that You would fill us with Your grace and power, just as You filled Stephen. Help us to serve faithfully in every role You give us, whether at tables or in public witness, always seeking to honor You. Grant us courage to speak Your truth with wisdom, even when it leads to opposition, trusting that Your presence will sustain us and Your Spirit will speak through us. May our character shine brightly under pressure, reflecting Your glory to a watching world.

> Empower us, Lord, to embrace the risks of obedience, knowing that true fruitfulness often comes through faithfully enduring opposition. May we live in such a way that our lives bring You honor, and may Your kingdom advance through our Spirit-led service and bold witness. In Jesus' mighty name we pray. Amen.
