# About

So, I am [fitzland](https://github.com/fitzland){:target="_blank"} or f1tzl4nd, a sinner, saved by the grace of God [Ephesians 2:8](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm){:target="_blank"}. I'm also the husband of a wonderful, supportive wife, the proud father of three wonderful children, and a Linux hobbyist. 

Currently, I'm working with [Debian 12](https://www.debian.org/News/2025/20250315){:target="_blank"} or 'Bookworm' (actually [Linux Mint Debian Edition](https://linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php){:target="_blank"}) which I believe is Version 6, called 'Faye'. I'm using the [i3](https://i3wm.org/){:target="_blank"} window manger. 

When I first started using Linux as a regular OS, I began with [Crunchbang](https://crunchbang.org/){:target="_blank"}. Truly, that was a wonderful experience. Corenominal made me love the [Openbox](https://openbox.org/){:target="_blank"} window manger (a dynamic window manager, I believe) and the rock-solid stability of Debian. It also helped that he made installation a step-by-step breeze. But, as most Linux people are likely to do, I wanted to try new things and eventually moved to [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/){:target="_blank"}. I learned a lot from Eric Dubois and his [Arco Linux](https://www.arcolinuxd.com/){:target="_blank"}. In any case, as I get older, I find I'm more happy with a stable environment. 

Now, I'm learning mostly from [JustALinuxGuy](https://github.com/drewgrif){:target="_blank"} and very happy. He has wonderful instructions on how to set up a website just like this one using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/){:target="_blank"}. I'm also a fan of [TYPO3](https://typo3.org/){:target="_blank"} but the complexity of that system keeps me in a love/hate relationship. 

This is one of the first pages I added to the website, and you can see I was practicing my linking skills. All these pages are edited with [micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. Thanks for stopping by.
