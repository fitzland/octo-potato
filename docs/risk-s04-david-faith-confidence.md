# David. Faith that Moves with Confidence
[1 Samuel 17:3-8, 32-37, 45-47](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_samuel/17.htm), BSB

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

**A**. Describe the biggest challenge or *giant* you've ever had to face (in school, work, or life).
<<<<<<< HEAD
**B**. What happens when you meet a major roadblock in life?

Society says to lower the volume of the negative voice in your head and puff up your confidence by believing in yourself to grow, adapt, and improve. 

The Bible says no roadblock or giant is too much for God. When we trust Him, He works on our behalf.
=======

**B**. Who is someone you know who exudes quiet confidence? What does that look like in their daily life?

*True faith doesn’t eliminate fear, but it fuels a confidence that is bigger than the challenge.*

### Core Message

Confident faith remembers God's past faithfulness, speaks His promises, and acts boldly in His name to achieve His victory.

## 1. Paralyzing Challenge

The enemy's challenge was designed to create fear and paralyze God's people.

Adversity provides the opportunity to display our faith.

### 1 Samuel 17:3-8, BSB

> **3** The Philistines stood on one hill and the Israelites stood on another, with the valley between them. **4** Then a champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out from the Philistine camp. He was six cubits and a span in height, **5** and he had a bronze helmet on his head. He wore a bronze coat of mail weighing five thousand shekels, **6** and he had armor of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. **7** The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. In addition, his shield bearer went before him. **8** And Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and array yourselves for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose one of your men and have him come down against me."

### Context & Insights

For 40 days, the army of Israel is paralyzed. The source of their fear is Goliath, a Philistine champion who seems invincible. The description of his armor and weapons is overwhelming. His height (over 9 feet), the weight of his armor (125 lbs), and the size of his spear were all meant to intimidate. His words were just as intimidating, mocking Israel and their God.

- *Champion*. (*eesh hah-bay-nah-yim*) meaning *man in the middle* or *man between two*. He was the one who would decide the battle by single combat.

- *Why do you come out...?* Goliath's taunt is designed to make Israel feel foolish and powerless. He questions their very right to be on the battlefield.

- *Servants of Saul*. He identifies them by their human king, Saul, who was also hiding in fear. He ignores their identity as the people of the living God.

**Illustration**. Imagine a brilliant but intimidating professor on the first day of class. He lists his impossible standards, mocks the abilities of previous students, and dares anyone to challenge his authority. His goal isn't to teach, but to intimidate the entire class into silence and submission before the semester even begins. Goliath's strategy was the same—to win the battle by fear before a single blow was struck.

### Nature of Giants

- What are the characteristics of the *giants* we face in our lives (e.g., a daunting diagnosis, a financial crisis, a relational conflict)?

- How does the enemy use intimidation and taunts to paralyze us today?

#### Common Answers

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Overwhelming Size**. Giants appear too big for us to handle, dominating our vision and making us feel small and insignificant.
=======
**Overwhelming Size**. Giants, by nature, appear too big for us to handle. They dominate our field of vision and make us feel small and insignificant.

**Public Challenge**. They often issue their challenges publicly, creating shame and adding the fear of failure in front of others.

**Mocking Identity**. The enemy's taunts often question our identity in Christ, our strength, and God's ability or willingness to help. He wants us to see ourselves as *servants of Saul* (our own weakness) rather than servants of God.
>>>>>>> 9678f1a6c8fb5d24bd7c76261813f70fa7b74649

**Public Challenge**. They often challenge us publicly, adding the fear of shame and failure to the threat.

**Identity Attack**. The enemy's taunts question our identity in Christ, our strength, and God's ability or willingness to help, wanting us to see ourselves as orphans rather than children of the King.

### Practical Application

**Identify the Giant's Voice**. What specific *taunts* are you hearing from the *giant* in your life? (e.g., "You'll never beat this," "You're not good enough," "God has abandoned you.")

**Re-frame the Challenge**. Beside each taunt, think of a truth from God's word that contradicts it. Begin to see the challenge not as a threat to your ability, but as an opportunity for God's power to be shown.

*Transition*. The army saw an unbeatable giant, but a young shepherd boy, arriving on the scene, saw something else entirely.

## 2. Confident Testimony

David's confidence was not in himself, but was built on a history of experiencing God's deliverance.

Past experiences can grow our faith.

### 1 Samuel 17:32-37, BSB

> **32** And David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail on account of this Philistine. Your servant will go and fight him!” **33** But Saul replied, “You cannot go out against this Philistine to fight him. You are just a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth.” **34** David replied, “Your servant has been tending his father’s sheep, and whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock, **35** I went after it, struck it down, and delivered the lamb from its mouth. If it reared up against me, I would grab it by its fur, strike it down, and kill it. **36** Your servant has killed lions and bears; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.” **37** David added, “The LORD, who delivered me from the claws of the lion and the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” “Go,” said Saul, “and may the LORD be with you.”

### Context & Insights

While Saul and his army saw only a boy, David saw a spiritual parallel. His confidence was not based on arrogance, but on his resume of God's faithfulness. He had faced deadly enemies before in the solitude of the wilderness, and God had delivered him every time.

- *You are just a boy*. Saul evaluates David based on outward appearance, the same way he evaluates Goliath. He sees the world's way.

- *Your servant has been...* David's response is a testimony. He doesn't argue his own strength; he presents the evidence of God's past deliverances. The lion and the bear were his private training ground for this public test.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- *The LORD, who delivered me... will deliver me*. David connects God's past action directly to his present challenge. He has a history with God, and that history informs his future. He sees Goliath not as a new threat, but as just another *lion or bear*.

### Power of Testimony

- How did David's private faithfulness in the pasture prepare him for his public battle in the valley?
- Why is it so important to remember and recount God's past faithfulness in our lives?

#### Common Answers

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Private Victories, Public Confidence**. God often tests and proves our faith in small, private battles before He calls us to larger, public ones. Faithfulness in the *pasture* builds the spiritual muscle needed for the *valley*.

**Private Victories, Public Confidence**. God often tests and proves our faith in small, private battles before He calls us to larger, public ones. Faithfulness in the *pasture* builds the spiritual muscle needed for the "valley."

**Remembrance Builds Faith**. Remembering what God has done in the past fuels our faith for the present. It provides a library of evidence that God is both able and willing to act on our behalf. It stops us from getting *spiritual amnesia*.

**A Defense Against Doubt**. When we are facing a new giant, our memory of God's past deliverances serves as a powerful defense against the taunts of fear and doubt.

**Defense Against Doubt**. When we are facing a new giant, our memory of God's past deliverances serves as a powerful defense against the taunts of fear and doubt.

### Practical Application

**Catalog Your Victories**. Take five minutes to list three to five specific times God has delivered you or shown His faithfulness in the past. These are your *lions and bears*.

**Connect Past to Present**. Look at the *giant* you are facing now. Verbally declare, "The Lord who delivered me from [past situation] will deliver me from this."

*Transition*. Armed with a shepherd's tools and a warrior's confidence, David walks into the valley, not with a strategy of his own, but with a declaration of faith.

## 3. Victorious Stand

Confident faith confronts the enemy not with worldly weapons, but in the name and power of the LORD.

### 1 Samuel 17:45-47, BSB

> **45** But David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. **46** This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand. This day I will strike you down, cut off your head, and give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the creatures of the earth. Then the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. **47** And all those assembled here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD’s, and He will give all of you into our hands.”

### Context & Insights

This is David's great battle speech. He doesn't trash-talk Goliath; he preaches a sermon. He reframes the entire conflict. This isn't about David vs. Goliath; it's about the God of Israel vs. a defiant enemy.

- *You come against me with... I come against you in the name of...*. David draws a sharp contrast between worldly power (sword, spear, javelin) and spiritual power (the name of the LORD). He is admitting he is outmatched on a physical level, but he is competing on a different level entirely.

- *The whole world will know that there is a God in Israel*. David's primary motivation is not his own survival or glory, but God's reputation. He sees this battle as a global testimony to the power of Yahweh.

- *The Battle is the LORD's* This is the ultimate statement of faith. David understood that he was just a vessel. The outcome did not depend on his strength or skill with a sling, but on God's power and sovereignty. Victory belonged to the Lord.

### Source of Victory

- What does it mean to face a challenge *in the name of the LORD of Hosts*?
- David's goal was that *the whole world will know*. How does having a God-centered motive (His glory) change the way we approach our battles?

#### Common Answers

**Acting on His Authority**. To act "in the name of the LORD" means to act as His representative, on His authority, and according to His will. It's a declaration that we are not acting on our own, but as agents of the King.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

**Accessing His Power**. It is an expression of dependence. We are admitting our inadequacy and relying completely on His power to accomplish the task.

**Shifting the Focus**. When our goal is God's glory, not our own comfort or success, it frees us from the pressure to perform. It makes us bold, because the outcome is about Him, not us. It turns our problems into a *platform for God to display His power*.

### Practical Application

**Speak to Your Giant**. Take the list of *giant's taunts* you wrote down earlier. Now, write a response to each one that starts with, *In the name of the Lord...* or *My God says...* Speak God's truth directly to the lies of the enemy.

**Declare *The Battle is the LORD's***. In prayer, formally surrender your "battle" to the Lord. Acknowledge that the outcome is in His hands and that your role is to be a faithful participant. This act of surrender is a powerful step of confidence.

## Closing

### Reflection

The entire army of Israel saw a giant they could not defeat. David saw a God who could not be defeated. His confidence was not a natural personality trait; it was a spiritual conviction forged in the pastures of private faithfulness. He remembered God's past deliverances, spoke God's truth to the enemy's lies, and stepped onto the battlefield with the unshakable belief that the battle—and the victory—belonged to the Lord. His story challenges us to stop measuring our giants and start remembering our God.

### Decision

<<<<<<< HEAD
*Giant's Taunt*. What lies from the enemy have you been listening to and believing?

*Shepherd's History*. What *lion and bear* victories from your past do you need to remember and recount?

*Warrior's Declaration*. Are you ready to confront your giant, not with your own strength, but *in the name of the LORD of Hosts*?
*Ultimate Motive*. Is your desire to win your battle for your own relief, or so that others will know *that there is a God in Israel*?
=======

### Challenges

#### 1. Build Your Resume of Faith.
Start a *Faithfulness Journal* this week. Each day, write down one thing God has done for you—a past victory, a recent provision, a moment of grace. Create a written record of your history with God.

#### 2. *Re-frame Your Battle*.
Take your biggest current challenge and write out a one-sentence prayer that re-frames it for God's glory. (e.g., *Lord, use my struggle with this illness to show Your strength to my doctors and family,* or *Lord, let me handle this conflict at work in a way that makes my colleagues ask about the God I serve*.)

#### 3. *Speak the Name.*
The next time you feel fear or anxiety about your *giant* this week, stop and say aloud, *The battle is the Lord's, and I come against this in the name of the Lord of Hosts*. Verbalize your confidence, even if your feelings haven't caught up yet.

#### 4. Memory Verse.
Memorize [1 Samuel 17:47](https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-47.htm) — "And all those assembled here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD’s, and He will give all of you into our hands.”

### Prayer

> Lord of Hosts, we come before you today and confess that we have been intimidated by the giants in our land. We have listened to their taunts and, like the army of Israel, we have been paralyzed by fear. Forgive us for forgetting Your power and Your past faithfulness.
> 
> Father, help us to build a confident faith like David's. Help us to remember the *lions and bears* You have already defeated in our lives. Give us the courage to stand up and testify that the God who delivered us then will deliver us now. Let our confidence not be in our own strength or weapons, but only in Your great name.
> 
> We declare today that our battles are Yours. We place them in Your hands. Use our struggles for Your glory, so that the world will know that there is a God in Israel, who saves not by sword or spear, but by His mighty power. We pray all this in the name of the one true victor, Jesus Christ. Amen.
