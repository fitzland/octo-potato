### LESSON FLOW AT A GLANCE

- **Divine Command to Wait (1:4-8)** → Promise

### Introduction

#### Icebreaker

> What's the longest you've ever had to wait in a line for something (a ride, a new product, a concert), and was it worth the wait?

#### Illustration. Honko-Second

We hate waiting. We live in a world of instant gratification, and any delay can feel maddening. One professor humorously suggested a new unit of time called the *honko-second*, defined as *the time between when the light changes and the person behind you honks his horn*. It would be the smallest measure of time known to man.

For those of us who want things in a *honko-second*, a season of waiting can feel like a punishment or a waste. 

- But what if God has something for us in those gaps that we can’t receive any other way? 
- What if the waiting room is actually a training ground? 

Jesus’s disciples found themselves in a divine waiting room, and their experience has powerful lessons for us.

#### Context. Why This Matters

Today’s passage picks up after Jesus’s resurrection and before His ascension. For forty days, Jesus appeared to His disciples with "many convincing proofs," teaching them about the kingdom of God. The disciples, who had been shattered by the crucifixion, were now electrified by the reality of the risen Christ. They were ready to act, ready to launch the movement. But Jesus’s first command to them was not to go, but to stop.

This lesson is for us when God’s plan involves a pause—when our career stalls, a relationship is on hold, or a ministry dream seems delayed. The disciples’ story teaches us that God-ordained waiting is never passive; it is active preparation for divine empowerment.

#### Point (Central Truth)

> *Use unexpected downtime to prepare for what’s next.*

Or to put it another way:

> *God equips those He calls, but His empowerment often requires a period of obedient, active waiting that prepares us for His work.*

### Divine Command to Wait

#### 📖 SCRIPTURE READING. Acts 1:4-8

> 4 While he was with them, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the Father’s promise. “Which,” he said, “you have heard me speak about; 5 for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit in a few days.” 6 So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?” 7 He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority. 8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”

With momentum building and the disciples ready for action, Jesus gives a counterintuitive command. The foundation of their future ministry would be built not on immediate action, but on obedient waiting.

#### Foundation. Command to Wait (v. 4-5)

Jesus’s instruction is clear and direct: "he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait." This wasn't a suggestion. Their mission was entirely dependent on a promised gift they had not yet received—the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

- **Key Insight**. Jesus reminds them (and us) that His mission must be accomplished in His power. As He said elsewhere, "apart from me you can do nothing" (John 15:5). The waiting was necessary because their human strength and enthusiasm were insufficient for the task ahead.

#### Redirect. Timeline to Task (v. 6-7)

The disciples immediately reveal their limited perspective: "Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?" They were still thinking of a political, earthly kingdom. Jesus doesn’t rebuke them, but He redirects them. He shifts their focus from the *when* (God's sovereign timeline) to the *what* (their mission).

- **Character Insight**. Our desire to know God's timeline often distracts us from our present assignment. Jesus teaches us to trust God with the "times or periods" and focus on the work He has given us to do right now.

#### Promise. Power for the Mission (v. 8)

This verse is the thesis for the entire book of Acts. The waiting has a purpose: to receive power. This power wasn't for personal gain or status; it was specifically for the task of being His witnesses. The waiting period was designed to empty them of self-reliance so they could be filled with His divine power.

#### EXTRA. Blueprint for Mission

Acts 1:8 is more than a command; it’s a divine strategy that ripples outward in concentric circles:

- **Jerusalem:** Your home base—family, neighbors, workplace.
- **Judea:** Your wider region—people culturally similar but outside your immediate circle.
- **Samaria:** The "other side of the tracks"—people geographically close but culturally different, requiring you to cross a barrier of comfort or prejudice.
- **Ends of the Earth:** The global mission to all people.

**Application**. Sometimes we are waiting for a call to the "ends of the earth" when God is preparing us for our "Jerusalem." The waiting period is often when God equips us for the mission field right outside our front door.

### Posture of Active Waiting

#### 📖 SCRIPTURE READING. Acts 1:12-14

> 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem—a Sabbath day’s journey away. 13 When they arrived, they went to the room upstairs where they were staying: Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. 14 They all were continually united in prayer, along with the women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.

After Jesus ascended into heaven, the waiting began. But the disciples show us that waiting on God is not passive. It is an active, intentional, and communal spiritual discipline.

#### Obedience. Returned to Jerusalem (v. 12)

The first thing they did was obey. Despite the danger in Jerusalem, the city that had just crucified their Lord, they returned as commanded. Their waiting was built on a foundation of simple obedience.

#### Unity. Gathered Together (v. 13-14a)

They didn't wait in isolation. They gathered in the upper room. Luke’s specific listing of the apostles, along with the mention of "the women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers," is significant. This was a united community.

#### Preparation. Devoted Themselves to Prayer (v. 14b)

This is the core of their active waiting: "They all were continually united in prayer." They didn't spend their time worrying, complaining, or strategizing. They were preparing. They were aligning their hearts with God, seeking His presence, and reinforcing their dependence on Him. Prayer was the spiritual workout that strengthened them for the mission to come.

#### EXTRA. Incubator for Conviction
Notice who is in the room. Jesus’s own brothers. The gospels show they were skeptics during His ministry (John 7:5). Now, after the resurrection, they are believers, united in prayer. James would go on to lead the Jerusalem church. This ten-day waiting period was an incubator where the shock of the resurrection solidified into unshakable conviction.

**Application**. When God makes us wait, He is often giving our faith time to travel from our head to our heart. He's allowing truth to become the kind of conviction that will sustain us through the mission ahead.

### Power in God's Perfect Timing

#### 📖 SCRIPTURE READING. Acts 2:1-4

> 1 When the day of Pentecost had arrived, they were all together in one place. 2 Suddenly a sound like that of a violent rushing wind came from heaven, and it filled the whole house where they were staying. 3 They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated and rested on each one of them. 4 Then they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, as the Spirit enabled them.

After ten days of prayerful, obedient waiting, the promise was fulfilled. God's timing was perfect, and His arrival was unmistakable.

#### Divine Moment. "When the day of Pentecost had arrived" (v. 1)

God’s timing is never arbitrary. Pentecost was a major Jewish festival celebrating the harvest, held fifty days after Passover. Devout Jews from all over the world were gathered in Jerusalem.

#### EXTRA. Prophetic Calendar

God's choice of this day was profoundly symbolic. Pentecost was also called the "Festival of First Fruits." On this exact day, God poured out His Spirit, and Peter preached. The result? 3,000 souls were saved—the **first fruits** of the New Covenant harvest. God aligned the launch of His church with His prophetic calendar to show this was His master plan all along.

#### Dramatic Arrival. Wind and Fire (v. 2-3)

The arrival of the Spirit wasn't subtle. It came "suddenly" with two powerful Old Testament symbols of God's presence: a sound like a violent wind and the sight of tongues of fire. The wind filled the whole house, signifying His pervasive presence. The fire separated and rested on *each one*, signifying that every believer was now personally indwelt and empowered by the Spirit.

#### Promised Empowerment. Filled and Speaking (v. 4)

This is the direct fulfillment of Acts 1:5 and 1:8. "They were all filled with the Holy Spirit." This filling was not a feeling, but a divine empowerment that had an immediate, mission-focused result: they began to speak in other tongues, declaring the wonders of God to the diverse crowd gathered outside. Their training was over; the mission had begun.

#### Radical Trust of Waiting. What They *Didn't* Do

Before we move to our own application, it's powerful to consider what the disciples *avoided* doing during their wait. Their actions are a radical contrast to our modern impulses:

- They **didn't scatter** in fear. They stayed together in the most dangerous city for them.
- They **didn't strategize.** There is no mention of a committee meeting or a marketing plan. They focused on prayer, not programs.
- They **didn't get impatient** and try to "get a head start" on the mission. They waited for the power source.
- They **didn't grumble** about the delay. They were united in purpose.

This provides a powerful diagnostic tool. When you're in a season of waiting, which of these temptations do you fall into most often? Do you try to take control, isolate yourself, or force God's hand? The disciples' example is a radical call to trust.

### Application & Challenges

#### Live as an Athlete in Training

The disciples’ waiting was a training season. God’s waiting periods in our lives are our training grounds. Here's how to adopt the posture of an "Athlete in Training" this week.

##### 1. Reframe Your Waiting Room

Identify the primary area where you feel you are waiting on God (a job, a relationship, a ministry). This week, intentionally stop calling it a *waiting room* and start calling it your *training ground*. What is one small, active step you can take to train in that area this week?

**Challenge**. Write down your *training ground*. Next to it, write one preparatory action you will take (e.g., "Pray for my future team," "Read a book on leadership," "Practice patience with my family").

##### 2. Practice Unified Prayer

The disciples were *continually united in prayer*. Waiting is not meant to be a solo sport. It builds community and dependence on God.

**Challenge**. Reach out to one trusted Christian friend this week. Share the area where you are waiting and ask them to be your prayer partner for this season. Be specific about how they can pray for you.

##### 3. Redeem the Small Gaps

God doesn't just work in the big seasons of waiting, but in the small, unexpected moments of downtime throughout our day.

**Challenge**. This week, when you find yourself with an unexpected five minutes (in a line, in traffic, waiting for a meeting), resist the urge to pull out your phone. Instead, use that "honko-second" to whisper a prayer of trust: "Lord, I trust Your timing. Prepare me for what's next."

### Conclusion

The disciples’ story proves that a divinely ordered pause is never wasted time. It is a sacred space where God empties us of our self-reliance, forges us into a unified community through prayer, and prepares us to receive the power we need to accomplish His mission. Our interruptions and seasons of inactivity are not roadblocks; they are the training grounds where God equips us for what He has planned next. Let's not waste our waiting.

#### Prayer

> Father, we praise You as the Lord of time and seasons. Your wisdom is perfect, and Your timing is always right, even when it feels slow to us. Thank you for the incredible gift of Your Holy Spirit, who empowers us to be Your witnesses.
>
> We confess our impatience and frustration in the waiting. We confess our tendency to rely on our own strength and to doubt Your plan when it involves a delay. Forgive us for treating waiting as wasted time instead of a sacred training ground.
>
> Lord, we ask you to transform our perspective. Help us to embrace our seasons of waiting with obedient hearts. Teach us to be active in our waiting—to be constant in prayer, united in fellowship, and diligent in preparation. Equip us with the character, skill, and the spiritual power we need for the mission you have called us to. And when Your perfect moment arrives, launch us out with boldness for Your glory.
>
> In the powerful name of Jesus, Amen.

#### Historical Background

**Pentecost (Festival of Weeks)**. One of the three major Jewish pilgrimage feasts, celebrating the first fruits of the wheat harvest. It occurred 50 days after Passover. God strategically chose this day, when Jerusalem was filled with Jews from "every nation under heaven" (Acts 2:5), to pour out His Spirit and launch the global mission of the church.

**Mount of Olives**. A ridge east of Jerusalem, significant in Jesus’s life, especially during His final week. It was the site of His ascension and, according to Zechariah 14:4, will be the site of His return.

**A Sabbath Day’s Journey**. The maximum distance a Jew was permitted to travel on the Sabbath, according to rabbinic tradition, roughly three-quarters of a mile.

#### Key Terms

**Baptized with the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5)**. Refers to the initial, unique event at Pentecost where the disciples were immersed in the power and presence of the Holy Spirit, marking the birth of the church. This is distinct from, but related to, the ongoing "filling" of the Spirit for daily Christian living (Ephesians 5:18).

**Witness (*martys*)**. The Greek word for "witness" is *martys*, from which we get the English word "martyr." For the early church, being a witness to the resurrection often meant being willing to testify even to the point of death.

**United (*homothymadon*)**. A key word in Acts, meaning "with one accord" or "one mind." It describes the profound unity of purpose and heart that characterized the early church as they waited, prayed, and ministered together.
