# God's Hand in Everyday Influence
**Matthew 5:13–16**

## Introduction

### Icebreaker
**Option A**. When have you tasted food that was supposed to be salty but was completely bland—or seen a light that was supposed to help but was hidden or burnt out?  
**Option B**. Think of a person whose life made God look unmistakably good to you. What was it about them that pointed you to the Father instead of to themselves?

*You don’t have to be loud or flashy to change the world—just salty and bright.*

### Core Message
**You are the salt and light on purpose—so live in such a way that people taste and see your Father and give the glory to Him alone.**

### Lesson Flow – Four Movements
1. **You Are Salt**. Identity and danger  
2. **You Are Light**. Identity and impossibility  
3. **Don’t Hide the Lamp**. The absurdity of concealment  
4. **Good Deeds, Greater Glory**. The ultimate purpose  

## 1. You Are Salt (Matthew 5:13)
**You are the salt of the earth**.

!!! quote "Matthew 5:13, BSB"
    **13** “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its savor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.”

### Teaching Insights
Jesus doesn’t say “You should be salt” or “Try to be salty.” He declares “You ARE.” Salt in the ancient world preserved meat, flavored food, and even purified offerings. The warning is stark: salt that becomes μωρανθῇ (foolish/insipid) is worthless and contemptible.

!!! question "Discussion"
    Where in your circles (family, work, social media, neighborhood) is moral or relational decay accelerating because your salt has lost its bite?

### Common Answers
**Blending in**. afraid to stand out  
- *follow-up*. What fear keeps you from seasoning the moment?  
**Silent when I should speak**. letting gossip or despair go unchallenged  
- *follow-up*. When was the last time someone noticed your presence made things better?

### Modern Application
Dead Sea salt scrub costs $40 a jar. If it has no bite, you feel ripped off. A Christian who looks Christian but has no preserving power is spiritual counterfeit salt.

## 2. You Are Light (Matthew 5:14–15)
**You are the light of the world**.

!!! quote "Matthew 5:14–15, BSB"
    **14** “You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.  
    **15** Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead they set it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.”

### Teaching Insights
Two impossibility statements drive the point home: a hill-city can’t hide, and no sane person lights a lamp just to cover it. Hiding the light is laughably absurd.

!!! question "Discussion"
    If a non-Christian followed you for a full week (phone, conversations, spending, entertainment), what would they conclude you truly love and live for?

### Common Answers
**Hiding at work or online**. staying silent about faith  
- *follow-up*. What specific basket do you keep throwing over your lamp?  
**Phone flashlight under the popcorn bucket**. glowing but useless in the dark theater  
- *follow-up*. When did you last feel the panic of “someone might see I’m a Christian”?

### Modern Application
Airport beacons are visible 30 miles away on a clear night. If someone throws a tarp over it “so it’s not so bright,” planes die. We are that beacon.

## 3. Don’t Hide the Lamp (Matthew 5:15)
**Absurdity is the point**.

### Teaching Insights
Jesus uses everyday humor: nobody lights a lamp to hide it. The command in v. 16 flows naturally—don’t do the ridiculous thing.

!!! question "Discussion"
    Name one place you regularly hide your lamp this week. Why are you hiding it?

### Modern Application
Sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do is simply move the basket.

## 4. Good Deeds, Greater Glory (Matthew 5:16)
**The ultimate purpose is the Father’s fame**.

!!! quote "Matthew 5:16, BSB"
    **16** In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

### Teaching Insights
The goal is not “so they will think how wonderful you are,” but so they glorify your Father. Every good deed is a neon arrow pointing away from us to Him.

!!! question "Discussion"
    When you do something good and get noticed, whose name do you most want praised—yours or the Father’s? Be brutally honest.

### Modern Application
Restaurant complainer rule: people only speak up when the soup is bland. They only glorify God when our lives actually make life taste better.

## Weekly Challenges
1. **Salt the Conversation**. Once this week, season a natural conversation with grace: sincere compliment, hope, or gentle confrontation. Notice what happens.  
2. **One Meal, One Story**. Invite someone for coffee or a meal. Before you part, tell one short story of God’s goodness—no preaching, just testimony.  
3. **Uncover One Lamp**. Identify one place you hide your light. This week let it shine once (post, speak, serve) so someone can trace it to Jesus.  
4. **Glory Redirect**. When complimented this week, immediately redirect: “Thank you—any good you see is Jesus in me.” Do it at least three times.

## Closing Reflection (Moment of Decision)
Right now you are living as one of four people.

**A.** Salt that has lost its savor—still in the jar but useless.  
**B.** A city on a hill with blackout curtains.  
**C.** A lamp glowing brightly under a basket.  
**D.** Salt and light pointing straight to the Father.

Which one are you today. And what basket will you move before sunset.

**Silent Reflection (60 seconds)**  
Lord, make me salty again. Help me move the basket.

## Closing Prayer
Father in heaven,  
You have not left us to blend in or burn out.  
You have made us salt on purpose—so forgive us for the places we have lost our savor.  
You have made us light on purpose—so forgive us for every basket we have thrown over the lamp.  
This week make our lives taste different and shine brighter.  
Let the world notice the flavor and the glow,  
and may every compliment be redirected straight to You.  
Use even our smallest deeds to make Your name famous.  
In the name of Jesus, the true Light of the world, Amen.

## Additional Reference
- **μωρανθῇ (mōranthē)**. “becomes foolish/insipid” – only here in the NT; emphasizes moral uselessness, not chemical change.  
- **City on a hill**. possibly refers to Jerusalem or any elevated Galilean village visible at night.  
- **Good deeds**. Greek καλά ἔργα – beautiful, excellent works that naturally draw attention to their Source.
