# Humility

Philippians 2:1-11, BSB

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

How do you see a *ME FIRST* attitude manifesting in today's culture, media, or even in daily interactions?

Here are some examples:

- Slogans like *You deserve it* and *Have it your way*.

- US vs. THEM—winning arguments over understanding or unity.

- People waiting for their turn to talk rather than listening.

- Refusing tasks deemed *beneath* a person's position or title.

- Aggressive driving, cutting others off, or refusing to let others merge.

- Keeping score in conflicts.

Given how pervasive *ME FIRST* attitudes are, what would it look like to live in a way that genuinely considers others first?

### Core Message

Consider and prioritize the needs of others, reflecting the sacrificial humility of Christ.

### Lesson Flow

1. [**Love Lays the Groundwork**]
2. [**Love Leads to Humble Service**]
3. [**Jesus' Example of Humility**]

## 1. Love Lays the Groundwork 

We just talked about *ME FIRST* attitudes in our culture. It’s easy to slip into that mode when we feel *insecure*, *overlooked*, or like we have to *fight for our place*. 

Paul points us to a completely different starting point—not our lack, but what we already have in Christ.

### Past Experience (Discussion:Mind)

> Think for a moment: When have you felt deeply encouraged, comforted, or genuinely loved? 

> How did that experience change your attitude toward others? Did it make you more open, more patient, more willing to listen?

[Allow sharing and then read the passage.]

### Philippians 2:1-2, BSB

> **1** ﻿Therefore if you have any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort from His love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, **2** ﻿then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being united in spirit and purpose. 

### Spiritual Realities (Discussion:Mind)

Paul uses a series of *IF clauses* (these do not imply doubt) to emphasize four gifts from God that every believer has:

- **Encouragement in Christ**. I'm not alone. My union with Christ gives me strength and belonging.
- **Comfort in Love**. I'm loved despite my unworthiness. 
- **Fellowship with Spirit**. I'm rightly aligned with God's will. United to Christ and to each other.
- **Affection & Compassion**. I feel the divine tenderness coming from God; this flows from us towards others.

> If we’re secure in Christ’s love, united by His Spirit, and objects of God’s affection—how should that shape the way we relate to other believers?

> OR, put another way, when you know you’re fully loved and secure, what happens to your need to prove yourself, defend your position, or put yourself first? 

[Allow responses]

*Transition*. With a foundation of love and unity, Paul now guides us toward the practical outworking of humility in our daily interactions.

## 2. Love Leads to Humble Service

If we’re secure in Christ’s love, we no longer have to build our own security by putting ourselves first. So what does that look like in real life? Paul gives us two clear commands.

### Philippians 2:3-4, BSB

> **3** ﻿Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty pride, but in humility consider others more important than yourselves. **4** ﻿Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. 

### What Humility Is Not (Discussion:Mind)

Paul begins by telling us what humility is NOT. 

He warns against two powerful motivators…

- **Selfish Ambition**. A desire for personal advancement or recognition. 
- **Empty Conceit**. An inflated sense of self-importance. 

> What do these look like in everyday life?

[Examples. Taking credit, talking over others, needing to be right, posting for appearances, etc.]

### What Humility Is (Discussion:Mind)

Next, Paul tells us to consider others as *more important* or more significant than ourselves.

> What does this (more important) actually mean?

> Does it mean thinking *less* OF ourselves, or thinking *less* ABOUT ourselves and *more* ABOUT others?

Paul isn't asking us to have low self-esteem or deny our God-given worth. Rather, he's calling us to shift our focus from self-promotion to others' welfare—to make their needs as important as our own, or even to prioritize them when appropriate.

### Humility in Practice (Discussion:Mind)

Finally, Paul makes it practical. He tells us how in humility we can consider others more important.

> What are some concrete ways we might do that in our daily lives, whether at home, work, or church?

[Allow group to respond]

**Listen Actively**. Giving full attention to what others are saying, seeking to understand their perspective before offering your own.

**Serve Behind the Scenes**. Doing tasks that may not be recognized or praised, simply for the benefit of others.

**Celebrate Successes**. Genuinely rejoicing in the achievements of others, rather than comparing or feeling envious.

### Self-Assessment (Reflection:Heart)

> When are you most tempted to operate out of *selfish ambition*—maybe when you feel threatened, overlooked, or in competition?

> When was the last time you intentionally put someone else's interests ahead of your own? If you can’t readily recall such an instance, what might that reveal about your current posture?

*Transition*. These are high standards—and we can’t do this alone in our own strength; we need Jesus' example and power. 

## 3. Jesus' Example of Humility

We’ve seen what humility looks like, and how hard it is to live out. Paul knows that—so he doesn’t just give us commands; he gives us the *ultimate example*.

### Philippians 2:5-11, BSB

> **5** ﻿Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus:
**6**﻿ Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, **7** ﻿but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in human likeness. **8** ﻿And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death—even death on a cross. 

> **9** ﻿Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place and gave Him the name above all names, **10** ﻿that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, **11** ﻿and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 

### Mind of Christ (Discussion:Mind)

Paul starts by directing us to adopt the same attitude, disposition, and mindset that characterized Jesus. Based on what we’ve studied so far, what do you think that mind includes?

[Possible answers: Others-focused, humble, obedient, secure in identity, not grasping for status.]

### Kenosis (Discussion:Mind)

Look at verses 6–8. Trace Jesus’ movement:

- Where did He start? (In the form of God—He was God)

- What did He choose not to do? (Grasp equality)

- What did He do instead? (Emptied Himself, took servant’s form, became human with limitations, obeyed to death on a cross)

The word *emptied* (kenosis) doesn’t mean He stopped being God—but He voluntarily set aside His glory and privileges and submitted to human limitations—hunger, fatigue, temptation, and death. 

> Why would He do that? What does that show us about God’s heart?

> What might it look like for us to *empty ourselves* of something we cling to—status, comfort, being right—in order to serve others?

### Exaltation (Discussion:Mind)

Now look at the turnaround in verses 9–11. 

> What happened because of Jesus’ humility and obedience? 

> How does God’s response to Jesus’ humility challenge our cultural view of how to get ahead?

The outcome of Christ's humility is universal recognition of His sovereign Lordship. This will happen, either willingly now or forcibly at the final judgment. 

### Pattern for Us (Discussion:Mind)

So the pattern is: Humility → Obedience → Exaltation (by God).

How does this pattern give us:

- A model to imitate when we’re called to humble ourselves?
- Hope when humility feels like losing, not winning?

*Transition*. This is where it all leads: not just trying harder, but letting Christ’s mindset reshape ours. And that leads us to a decision.

## Closing

We’ve seen Christ’s humility, His example, and His exaltation. Now Paul’s question becomes ours: Will we let His mind shape ours?

### Decision (Will)

-   **Christ's Mind**. Will you intentionally cultivate the mindset of Christ, prioritizing others and His glory above your own desires and ambitions?
-   **Path to Exaltation**. Are you willing to embrace the path of humble service, trusting that God's plan for your exaltation (and His glory) unfolds through self-giving, just as it did for Jesus?

### Challenges (Practice)

**Others-First**. Identify one person (at home, work, or church) and intentionally seek out a way to put their interests or needs before your own, without seeking recognition.

**Humility Audit**. Reflect on your interactions, asking: "Did I seek my own interests, or did I truly consider others more significant? Did I cling to my 'rights' or embrace a servant's posture?" Confess areas of pride and ask for God's help.

**Memory Verse**. Memorize Philippians 2:3. Do nothing from selfish ambition or empty conceit, but with humility of mind consider others more significant than yourselves.

### Prayer

> Heavenly Father, we confess that our hearts are naturally prone to pride, selfishness, and a *ME FIRST* attitude. We cling to our rights and seek our own glory, rather than humbly serving others as Christ served us. Forgive us, Lord, for our failure to reflect the beautiful humility of Jesus.
>
> We pray that by Your Holy Spirit, You would transform our minds and hearts. Grant us the grace to adopt the mind of Christ—to consider others more significant than ourselves, to lay aside our own interests, and to obey You fully, even when it costs us. Help us to find our joy in unity and our purpose in self-giving love.
>
> May our lives, marked by genuine humility, bring You immense glory, Father, as every knee ultimately bows and every tongue confesses Jesus Christ as Lord. Amen.
