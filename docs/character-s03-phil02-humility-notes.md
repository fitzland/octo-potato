# Humility

Philippians 2:1-11, BSB

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

**A**. Think about a time you witnessed someone genuinely putting the needs of others before their own, even when it was difficult. What impact did that have on you?

**B**. How do you see a “me first” attitude manifesting in today's culture, media, or even in daily interactions?

### Core Message

Consider the needs of others before your own, reflecting the sacrificial humility of Christ.

## 1. Love Lays the Groundwork for Humility

Humility is not merely an act but a posture of the heart, deeply rooted in the love and unity we share in Christ. Before we can genuinely serve others, our internal landscape must be aligned with God's Spirit.

### Philippians 2:1-2, BSB

> **1** If therefore there is any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort from love, if any fellowship in the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, **2** make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.

### Context & Insights

- **Any Encouragement in Christ**. Paul uses a series of "if" clauses not to imply doubt, but to emphasize the profound realities of Christian experience: the comfort found in Christ, the motivation from God’s love, the shared life in the Holy Spirit, and the tender mercies we receive from Him. These are the *foundations* for humility.
- **Make My Joy Complete**. Paul's deepest desire for the Philippian believers was not for personal gain, but for their spiritual unity and maturity. Their unified love and shared purpose would bring him profound joy, echoing Christ's own joy in His disciples' unity.
- **Same Mind, Same Love, Full Accord, One Mind**. This isn't a call for uniformity of opinion on every minor issue, but a unity of purpose, affection, and perspective rooted in Christ. It's about a shared commitment to gospel values and a common goal, even amidst diverse gifts and personalities.
    - **Illustration**: Imagine an orchestra. Each musician plays a different instrument and reads different notes, but they are all united by the conductor's vision and the single musical piece they are performing. Their individual contributions create a harmonious whole.

### Unity in Christ (Discussion:Mind)

> Paul outlines several spiritual realities (encouragement in Christ, comfort from love, fellowship in the Spirit, affection, compassion) as the basis for unity. How do these realities foster a mindset of unity and humble service?

**Shared Experience**. These shared spiritual experiences bind believers together, reminding them that they are part of something larger than themselves and dependent on God.

**Motivation for Others**. The love and compassion received from Christ compels believers to extend that same love and compassion to others.

### Personal Reflection (Reflection:Heart)

> Where in your life or relationships are you most prone to division or a "my way" attitude, and how might remembering these spiritual realities reorient your heart towards unity?

*Transition*. With a foundation of love and unity, Paul now guides us toward the practical outworking of humility in our daily interactions.

## 2. Love Leads Us to Humbly Serve Others

Humility moves beyond mere thought; it demands action. It challenges our inherent self-centeredness, urging us to consider the well-being and perspectives of others as highly as—or even more highly than—our own.

### Philippians 2:3-4, BSB

> **3** Do nothing from selfish ambition or empty conceit, but with humility of mind consider others more significant than yourselves. **4** Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.

### Context & Insights

- **Selfish Ambition or Empty Conceit**. Paul directly confronts two powerful motivators of human behavior: the desire for personal advancement or recognition (`selfish ambition`) and an inflated sense of self-importance (`empty conceit`). These are the antitheses of humility and destroy unity.
    - **Illustration**: Think of a team project where one member only cares about their individual contribution being highlighted, or tries to take credit for others' work. This undermines the whole team's effort and spirit.
- **Humility of Mind**. This is not about self-deprecation or thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself *less often* and focusing on others. It's an accurate assessment of one's place before God and in relation to others, free from pride.
- **Consider Others More Significant**. This is a radical call. It means actively seeking the good of others, valuing their needs, opinions, and contributions above your own. It requires empathy and intentionality. It shifts our focus from "what's in it for me?" to "how can I bless them?"
- **Interests of Others**. This is the practical outworking of considering others more significant. It means being actively concerned with their well-being, success, and spiritual growth, not just your own.

### Practicing Humility (Discussion:Mind)

> What are some concrete ways we can actively "consider others more significant than ourselves" in our daily lives, whether at home, work, or church?

**Listen Actively**. Giving full attention to what others are saying, seeking to understand their perspective before offering your own.

**Serve Behind the Scenes**. Doing tasks that may not be recognized or praised, simply for the benefit of others.

**Celebrate Others' Successes**. Genuinely rejoicing in the achievements of others, rather than comparing or feeling envious.

### Self-Assessment (Reflection:Heart)

> When was the last time you intentionally put someone else's interests ahead of your own, and what was the outcome (both for you and for them)? If you can't readily recall such an instance, what does that reveal about your current posture?

*Transition*. While these commands challenge us deeply, Paul immediately provides the ultimate example and motivation: the humility of Jesus Christ Himself.

<h2>3. Follow the Example of Jesus in Displaying Humility</h2>

The call to humility is not an abstract ideal but a tangible imitation of Christ. His journey from divine glory to humble servitude, and then to ultimate exaltation, provides both the pattern and the power for our own humble living.

<h3>Philippians 2:5-11, BSB</h3>

> **5** Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, **6** who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God as something to be grasped, **7** but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in human likeness. **8** And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. **9** Therefore God highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name, **10** so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, **11** and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

<h3>Context & Insights</h3>

- **Let This Mind Be In You**. This is a direct command to adopt the same attitude, disposition, and mindset that characterized Jesus. It's a call to internalize His self-giving nature.
- **Existing in the Form of God**. Jesus was fully God, possessing all the divine attributes and prerogatives. He did not merely *appear* to be God, but *was* God.
- **Did Not Consider Equality with God as Something to Be Grasped**. Unlike Adam, who grasped for equality with God, Jesus, who possessed it, did not cling to His divine privileges. He willingly laid them aside for a greater purpose.
- **Emptied Himself**. The *kenosis*. This doesn't mean Jesus ceased to be God or divested Himself of His divine nature. Rather, He voluntarily surrendered the independent exercise of His divine prerogatives, choosing instead to live in dependence on the Father and take on human limitations.
    - **Illustration**: It's like a king taking off his crown and royal robes to serve as a peasant among his people, not ceasing to be king, but choosing to live and work as one of them for a period.
- **Taking the Form of a Servant, Made in Human Likeness**. Jesus took on true humanity, becoming fully human in every respect, yet without sin. His identity shifted from glorious God to humble servant.
- **Humbled Himself by Becoming Obedient to the Point of Death**. His humility culminated in complete obedience, even to the most ignominious and painful death imaginable: crucifixion. This was the ultimate act of self-giving.
- **Therefore God Highly Exalted Him**. Christ's self-humiliation was not an end in itself, but the pathway to ultimate exaltation. God the Father vindicated and glorified Him. This is a foundational principle of the kingdom: true greatness comes through humble service.
- **Every Knee Should Bow... Every Tongue Confess**. The outcome of Christ's humility is universal recognition of His sovereign Lordship. This will happen, either willingly now or forcibly at the final judgment. It is to the ultimate glory of God the Father.

<h3>The Kenosis and Our Lives (Discussion:Mind)</h3>

> The concept of Jesus "emptying Himself" (kenosis) is profound. How does Jesus's example of not clinging to His divine prerogatives, but taking the form of a servant, challenge our natural tendencies to cling to our rights, status, or comforts?

**Re-evaluating "Rights"**. Jesus's example forces us to question what "rights" we truly possess, especially if they hinder our ability to serve others or glorify God.

**Serving from Position**. True authority and significance, as demonstrated by Christ, come not from demanding service but from humbly giving it.

<h3>Imitating Christ's Humility (Reflection:Heart)</h3>

> In what specific area of your life do you find it most difficult to "let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus," particularly in laying aside your own preferences or perceived rights for the sake of another or for the gospel?

*Transition*. The life and exaltation of Christ provide the perfect example and motivation for living a life of profound, others-centered humility.

<h2>Closing</h2>

<h3>Decision (Will)</h3>

-   **Christ's Mind**. Will you intentionally cultivate the mindset of Christ, prioritizing others and His glory above your own desires and ambitions?
-   **Path to Exaltation**. Are you willing to embrace the path of humble service, trusting that God's plan for your exaltation (and His glory) unfolds through self-giving, just as it did for Jesus?

<h3>Challenges (Practice)</h3>

**1. Others-First Initiative**. This week, identify one person (at home, work, or church) and intentionally seek out a way to put their interests or needs before your own, without seeking recognition.

**2. Humility Audit**. Reflect daily on your interactions, asking: "Did I seek my own interests, or did I truly consider others more significant? Did I cling to my 'rights' or embrace a servant's posture?" Confess areas of pride and ask for God's help.

**3. Memory Verse**. Memorize Philippians 2:3 — "Do nothing from selfish ambition or empty conceit, but with humility of mind consider others more significant than yourselves."

<h3>Prayer</h3>

> Heavenly Father, we confess that our hearts are naturally prone to pride, selfishness, and a "me first" attitude. We often cling to our rights and seek our own glory, rather than humbly serving others as Christ served us. Forgive us, Lord, for our failure to reflect the beautiful humility of Jesus.
>
> We pray that by Your Holy Spirit, You would transform our minds and hearts. Grant us the grace to adopt the mind of Christ—to consider others more significant than ourselves, to lay aside our own interests, and to obey You fully, even when it costs us. Help us to find our joy in unity and our purpose in self-giving love.
>
> May our lives, marked by genuine humility, bring You immense glory, Father, as every knee ultimately bows and every tongue confesses Jesus Christ as Lord. Amen.
