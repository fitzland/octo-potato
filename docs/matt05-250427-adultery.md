## Righteousness---Adultery & Lust {#righteousnessadultery-lust .western}

### Introduction & Icebreaker (5-10 minutes) {#introduction-icebreaker-5-10-minutes .western}

#### Goal {#goal .western}

Engage the group and get them thinking about societal vs. biblical
standards and the importance of inner life.

#### Icebreaker {#icebreaker .western}

> Think about the phrase *purity of heart*.\
> What does that phrase mean to you,\
> even before we dive into the text?

> When you hear the commandment\
> \'You shall not commit adultery,\'\
> what actions or scenarios immediately come to mind?

Think about the traditional, external understanding.

> In today\'s world, where do you think the *line* is drawn by most
> people regarding faithfulness in relationships? Is it mostly about
> physical actions?

#### Context {#context .western}

Jesus continues to contrast the common understanding of the Law with a
deeper meaning intended by God.

He's laying out the ethics and righteousness expected of citizens in the
Kingdom of Heaven.

And, He\'s raising the standard from *outward conformity* to **inward
transformation**.

You have heard it said

### Review {#review .western}

Jesus didn't come to *abolish* the Law, but rather to **fulfill**.

Our righteousness *must exceed* that of the **Pharisees**.

Our internal *anger* can lead to outward **murder**.

### Letter of the Law (5 minutes) {#letter-of-the-law-5-minutes .western}

> `Matthew 5:27`{.western}. You have heard that it was said,\
> 'You shall not commit adultery.'

Jesus acknowledges the established commandment against the act of
adultery.

#### Where does this command come from? {#where-does-this-command-come-from .western}

This was the seventh command of the Decalogue.

> `Exodus 20:14`{.western}. You shall not *commit adultery*.

[moicheuō]{.dfn}. The primary focus was avoiding the **physical act**
itself. The command was an *external boundary*.

The general understanding was that the command was fulfilled by simply
avoiding a physical act.

#### What were the consequences? {#what-were-the-consequences .western}

Under Old Testament Law the consequences were severe.

> `Leviticus 20:10`{.western}. If a man commits adultery with another
> man's wife---with the wife of his neighbor---both the adulterer and
> the adulteress must surely *be put to death*.

### Spirit of the Law (10-15 minutes) {#spirit-of-the-law-10-15-minutes .western}

> `Matthew 5:28`{.western}. But I tell you that anyone who *looks at a
> woman lustfully* has already **committed adultery** with her in his
> heart.

#### How does Jesus change the understanding? {#how-does-jesus-change-the-understanding .western}

*But I tell you*\...Jesus speaks with divine authority, giving the true
interpretation. The focus shifts from the action to the intention and
desire.

Jesus reveals that God\'s standard includes the heart; lustful intent is
adultery of the heart.

[blepōn]{.dfn}. looking---a common word for physical sight; a present
active participle---continuous action; looking long enough for intent to
form.

[epith]{.dfn}[y]{.dfn}[mē]{.dfn}[sai]{.dfn}. lustfully---the Greek
implies looking with the purpose of desiring or coveting sexually. It\'s
not merely noticing someone\'s appearance, but indulging a desire for
them in the heart.

**A deliberate look with a specific purpose or intent.**

Jesus equates this internal sin (*in his heart*) with the act itself in
terms of guilt before God.

He emphasizes God\'s concern with our inner world---our thoughts,
desires, and motivations.

> `Proverbs 4:23`{.western}. Guard your heart above all else, for it is
> the source of life.

> `Mark 7:21-23`{.western}. For from within, out of the heart of man,
> come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,
> coveting, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander,
> arrogance, and foolishness.

#### Broadening Lust {#broadening-lust .western}

Jesus specifically addresses *sexual lust* here, but the principle of
**internal desire leading to sin** can apply more broadly.

> `1 John 2:16`{.western}. For all that is in the world---the desires of
> the flesh, the desires of the eyes, and the pride of life---is not
> from the Father but from the world.

##### What are some other ways that lust can manifest? {#what-are-some-other-ways-that-lust-can-manifest .western}

Lust for power.

Lust for possessions.

Lust for status.

Lust for food.

Lust for control.

> `James 1:14-15`{.western}. But each one is tempted when by his own
> evil desire he is lured away and enticed. Then after desire has
> conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is fully grown,
> gives birth to death.

Shows the progression starting with internal desire.

> `Colossians 3:5`{.western}. Put to death, therefore, the components of
> your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires,
> and greed, which is idolatry.

This verse links lust, evil desires, & greed directly to idolatry.
**Putting something in front of God**.

#### Key Point {#key-point .western}

We must not place our desires for things above our desire for God.

### Radical Measures for Purity (15-20 minutes) {#radical-measures-for-purity-15-20-minutes .western}

> `Matthew 5:29-30`{.western}. If your right eye causes you to sin,
> gouge it out and throw it away. *It is better* for you *to lose one
> part* of your body **than for your whole body to be thrown into
> hell**.

> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it
> away. *It is better* for you *to lose one part* of your body than
> **for your whole body to go into hell**.

> `Mark 9:43, 47`{.western}. If your hand causes you to sin, cut it
> off\... And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better
> for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes
> and be thrown into hell\...

#### What Jesus says---Hyperbole {#what-jesus-sayshyperbole .western}

Jesus uses **hyperbole** (*exaggeration for emphasis*). He is not
commanding literal self-mutilation.

Actually, a blind person can still lust and a person with no hands can
still sin in his heart.

[right eye]{.dfn}. what we look at, what takes in temptation

[right hand]{.dfn}. what we do, actions that lead to sin

These represent things valuable to us or pathways through which
temptation comes.

Jesus is telling us that the danger of sin is so great that we must take
decisive, drastic, measures to remove its sources from our lives.

#### What Jesus means---A Principle {#what-jesus-meansa-principle .western}

Be ruthless in identifying and removing anything that causes you to sin
or stumble, no matter how valuable it may seem.

> `Colossians 3:5`{.western}. Put to death, therefore, the components of
> your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires,
> and greed, which is idolatry.

> `1 Corinthians 9:27`{.western}. No, I discipline my body and make it
> my slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not
> be disqualified. (Paul\'s doesn't want to be a hypocrite so he takes
> spiritual discipline seriously).

#### A Helpful Comparison {#a-helpful-comparison .western}

*Losing a part* (a source of temptation, a habit, a relationship, access
to certain media) is far better than **losing your whole self** to
judgment (hell---Gehenna, the place of final judgment).

It demands decisive action, not passive hopefulness.

*What things trigger lustful thoughts or actions in my life?*

**What** **is it**. dismissing the significance of intentional looks

> `Jeremiah 17:9`{.western}. justification is self-deception.

**What to do**. honest self-assessment and repentance.

##### blaming others or our circumstances. {#blaming-others-or-our-circumstances. .western}

**What** **is** **it**. shifting the responsibility for my own lustful
thoughts or actions onto external factors.

**How it looks**. she shouldn\'t have dressed that way; media is full of
it, how can I avoid it?; if my life weren\'t so stressful, I wouldn\'t
need this escape; it\'s my spouse\'s fault for...; she flirted with me
first.

> `J`{.western}`ames 1:14`{.western}. we are tempted when drawn away *by
