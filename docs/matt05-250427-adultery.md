# Adultery & Lust (Matthew 5.27-30)

## Introduction

### Structure/Outline

Manifesto of the King

1.  Citizens of the Kingdom (ch 5)
    
    1.  Quality (1-12)
        
    2.  Function (13-16)
        
    3.  **Motive (17-48)**
        
2.  Values of the Kingdom (ch 6)
    
3.  Relationship with the Kingdom (ch 7)

!!! question "Icebreaker"

    Think about the phrase *purity of heart*. What does that phrase mean to you?

    When you hear the commandment 'You shall not commit adultery,' what actions or scenarios immediately come to mind?

Think about the traditional, external understanding.

In today's world, where do you think the _line_ is drawn by most people regarding faithfulness in relationships? Is it mostly about **physical actions**?

### Context

Jesus continues to contrast the common understanding of the Law with a deeper meaning intended by God.

He's laying out the ethics and righteousness expected of citizens in the Kingdom of Heaven.

And, He's raising the standard from *outward conformity* to **inward transformation**.

> You have heard it said…

> But I say to you…

### Review

Jesus didn't come to *abolish* the Law, but rather to **fulfill**.

Our righteousness *must exceed* that of the **Pharisees**.

Our internal *anger* can lead to outward **murder**.

## Letter of the Law

!!! quote "Matthew 5:27"

    You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'

Jesus acknowledges the established commandment against the act of adultery.

### Where does this command come from?

This was the seventh command of the Decalogue.

> [`Exodus 20:14`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-14.htm). You shall not *commit adultery*.

[`moicheuō`] The primary focus was avoiding the **physical act** itself. The command was an *external boundary*.

The general understanding was that the command was fulfilled by simply avoiding a physical act.

### What were the consequences?

Under Old Testament Law the consequences were severe.

> [`Leviticus 20:10`](https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm). If a man commits adultery with another man's wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress must surely *be put to death*.

## Spirit of the Law

!!! quote "Matthew 5:28"
    
    But I tell you that anyone who *looks at a woman lustfully* has already **committed adultery** with her in his heart.

### How does Jesus change the understanding?

*But I tell you*… Jesus speaks with divine authority, giving the true interpretation. The focus shifts from the action to the intention and desire.

Jesus reveals that God's standard includes the heart; lustful intent is adultery of the heart.

[`blepōn`] looking—a common word for physical sight; a present active participle—continuous action; looking long enough for intent to
form.

[`epithymēsai`]. lustfully—the Greek implies looking with the purpose of desiring or coveting sexually. It's not merely noticing someone's appearance, but indulging a desire for them in the heart.

**A deliberate look with a specific purpose or intent.**

Jesus equates this internal sin (*in his heart*) with the act itself in terms of guilt before God.

He emphasizes God's concern with our inner world—our thoughts, desires, and motivations.

> [`Proverbs 4:23`](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-23.htm). Guard your heart above all else, for it is the source of life.

> [`Mark 7:21-23`](https://biblehub.com/mark/7.htm#21). For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, arrogance, and foolishness.

### Broadening Lust

Jesus specifically addresses *sexual lust* here, but the principle of **internal desire leading to sin** can apply more broadly.

> [`1 John 2:16`](https://biblehub.com/1john/2-16.htm). For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not from the Father but from the world.

#### What are some other ways that lust can manifest?

Lust for power.

Lust for possessions.

Lust for status.

Lust for food.

Lust for control.

> [`James 1:14-15`](https://biblehub.com/james/1.htm#14). But each one is tempted when by his own evil desire he is lured away and enticed. Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is fully grown, gives birth to death.

Shows the progression starting with internal desire.

### Key Point

We must not place our desires for things above our desire for God.

## Radical Measures for Purity

!!! quote "Matthew 5:29-30"

    If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. *It is better* for you *to lose one part* of your body **than for your whole body to be thrown into hell**.
    
    And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. *It is better* for you *to lose one part* of your body than **for your whole body to go into hell**.

> [`Mark 9:43, 47`](https://biblehub.com/mark/9.htm#43). If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off… And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell…

### What Jesus says—Hyperbole

Jesus uses **hyperbole** (*exaggeration for emphasis*). He is not commanding literal self-mutilation.

Actually, a blind person can still lust and a person with no hands can still sin in his heart.

[`right eye`]. what we look at, what takes in temptation

[`right hand`]. what we do, actions that lead to sin

These represent things valuable to us or pathways through which temptation comes.

Jesus is telling us that the danger of sin is so great that we must take decisive, drastic, measures to remove its sources from our lives.

### What Jesus means—A Principle

Be ruthless in identifying and removing anything that causes you to sin or stumble, no matter how valuable it may seem.

> [`Colossians 3:5`](https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm). Put to death, therefore, the components of your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry.

> [`1 Corinthians 9:27`](https://1corinthians/9-27.htm). No, I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified. (Paul's doesn't want to be a hypocrite so he takes spiritual discipline seriously).

### A Helpful Comparison

*Losing a part* (a source of temptation, a habit, a relationship, access to certain media) is far better than **losing your whole self** to judgment (hell—Gehenna, the place of final judgment).

It demands decisive action, not passive hopefulness.

*What things trigger lustful thoughts or actions in my life?*

## Application & Discussion

### What are some common traps we fall into? {#what-are-some-common-traps-we-fall-into .western}

### What does gouging & cutting look like today? {#what-does-gouging-cutting-look-like-today .western}

#### just looking.

**What** **is it**. dismissing the significance of intentional looks that fuel desire; treating the eyes as passive observers rather than gateways to the heart.

**How it looks**. it's natural to notice attractive people, I can't help what my eyes see; it was only for a second.

> `James 1:14-15`. a seed of lust is planted under the guise of harmless observation.

**What to do**. be mindful of your gaze and intent.

#### secrecy.

**What** **is** **it**. hiding thoughts, struggles, online activities, or viewing habits related to lust from God and others.

**How it looks**. clearing browser history, using incognito mode, deleting messages, avoiding conversations.

> `John 3:19-20`. sin thrives in darkness.

**What to do**. confession and accountability.

#### justifying thoughts.

**What** **is** **it**. creating rationalizations or excuses for entertaining lustful thoughts or engaging in borderline behaviors.

**How it looks**. everyone struggles with this; it's just a fantasy, it's not hurting anyone; my spouse isn't meeting my needs, so this is understandable; compared to others, my struggle is minor.

> `Jeremiah 17:9`. justification is self-deception.

**What to do**. honest self-assessment and repentance.

#### blaming others or our circumstances.

**What** **is** **it**. shifting the responsibility for my own lustful thoughts or actions onto external factors.

**How it looks**. she shouldn't have dressed that way; media is full of it, how can I avoid it?; if my life weren't so stressful, I wouldn't need this escape; it's my spouse's fault for…; she flirted with me first.

> `James 1:14`. we are tempted when drawn away *by our own* evil desire.

**What to do**. take personal responsibility.

#### feeding desires through media.

**What** **is** **it**. carelessly consuming content or placing oneself in environments that stimulate lustful desires.

**How it looks**. watching movies/shows known for explicit content; endlessly scrolling through provocative social media feeds; seeking out pornography; frequenting places where temptation is high; engaging in inappropriate online chats.

> `Romans 13:14`. making provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.

**What to do**. radical removal of sources & intentional pursuit of pure influences.

*This standard seems impossibly high.*

### How can we proactively cultivate purity of heart? {#how-can-we-proactively-cultivate-purity-of-heart .western}

#### grace

God's grace empowers us to live righteously.

> `Titus 2:11-12`. For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people. It trains us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live sensible, righteous, and godly lives in the present age…

> `Hebrews 4:16`. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.

#### dependence on the Holy Spirit

We cannot achieve heart purity through willpower.

> `Galatians 5:16`. So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.

> `Zechariah 4:6`. …'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of Hosts.

#### forgiveness 

Forgiveness frees us from the guilt and shame.

> `1 John 1:9`. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

> `Psalm 103:12`. as far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.

#### community support

We are not meant to fight these battles alone.

> `James 5:16`. Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed.

> `Proverbs 27:17`. As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.

#### meditating on Scripture

Filling our minds with truth displaces sinful thoughts.

> `Psalm 119:9, 11`. How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to Your word… I have hidden Your word in my heart that I might not sin against You.

> `Joshua 1:8`. This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.

#### prayer

Communication with God is essential for strength, wisdom and deliverance from temptation.

> `Matthew 26:41`. Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

> `Matthew 6:13 `{.western}(Part of the Lord's Prayer). And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

#### focusing thoughts on God

Directing our minds towards God shifts our desires.

> `Matthew 6:33`. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you.

> `Hebrews 12:2`. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith…

#### filling mind with good things

Choosing what to dwell on is crucial for mental purity.

> `Philippians 4:8`. Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.

> `Romans 12:2`. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—His good, pleasing and perfect will.
