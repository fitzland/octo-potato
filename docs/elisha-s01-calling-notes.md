# God's Hand in Our Calling
**1 Kings 19:19-21 & 2 Kings 2:7-15**

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

**A**. "Think about a major life change you've made—like starting a new job, moving to a new city, or even getting married. What was the most exciting part of that change, and what was the scariest part of leaving your 'old life' behind?"

**B**. "What's the biggest 'all-in' commitment you've ever made, where you knew there was no turning back? What did it feel like to take that leap?"

*Elisha faced a similar moment of no-turning-back commitment. Today we'll follow him through three pivotal moments that reveal how God calls us and how we should respond.*

### Core Message

The story of Elisha's calling demonstrates a powerful, timeless truth about how God summons us to His purpose. Our central message for today is this:

**God's call is not an invitation to debate our adequacy, but a summons to demonstrate our commitment through immediate and irreversible action.**

### Lesson Flow

Elisha's journey from a wealthy farmer to God's prophet unfolds in three distinct acts, each with a memorable phase:

- Call in the Field

- Years of Hidden Service

- Confirmation at the River

## 1. Call in the Field (1 Kings 19:19-21)
**Burn the Plow** - The moment of divine interruption and radical commitment.

!!! quote "1 Kings 19:19-21, BSB"

    **19** So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him. **20** Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. "Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye," he said, "and then I will follow you."

    "Go back," Elijah replied. "What have I done to you?"

    **21** So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant.

### Setting

A field, representing Elisha's prosperous, secure, and successful worldly life. With twelve yoke of oxen, he was a man of significant status and wealth—this wasn't a small family farm, but a substantial agricultural operation.

### Summons

Elijah's act of throwing his mantle over Elisha was a silent, symbolic summons. It was an invitation to leave behind his current identity and take up the authority, responsibility, and identity of God's prophet.

### Response

Elisha's response is one of total surrender. He doesn't debate his adequacy or make excuses. *This stands in stark contrast to other biblical heroes:*
- Moses argued, "Who am I? ... I am slow of speech."
- Gideon protested, "My clan is the weakest... I am the least in my family."
- Jeremiah objected, "I do not know how to speak; I am too young."

*Elisha, however, did not focus on his own ability, but on the authority of the Caller.* He demonstrates his trust by slaughtering the oxen (sacrificing his wealth) and burning the plow (destroying his "Plan B"). This is his *Burn the Plow* moment—a public, costly, and irreversible commitment.

**Symbolism of His Actions**.

- **Slaughtering the oxen**. An irreversible break with his past—there was no going back

- **Burning the plowing equipment**. Using his former tools to cook the meat—a complete transformation of his old life

- **The feast**. A communal celebration blessing his household and community with the sacrifice (in ancient times, households included extended family and servants)

- **Following Elijah as servant**. From master to servant—embracing humility as the path to greater calling

**Modern "Plows" We Might Need to Burn**.

- The comfort zone that keeps us from obeying God

- The Plan B career we're keeping "just in case"

- The financial safety net we're trusting more than God

- The relationship that's holding us back from God's best

- The reputation or status we're unwilling to risk

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    Why do you think God often calls us when we're comfortable and successful?

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    What made Elisha's response so radical? What would a "safe" response have looked like?

## 2. Apprenticeship - Years of Hidden Service (The In-Between Years)
**Pour the Water** - The spectacular call followed by a long season of unglamorous preparation.

### Setting
The road, the wilderness—wherever Elijah went. This was the "School of Pouring Water."

### Process
Elisha went from being a master to being a servant—from controlling twelve yoke of oxen to pouring water on someone else's hands. [`2 Kings 3:11`](https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-11.htm) describes him as the one "who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah." This humble, hidden service was the training ground where his character was forged and his initial commitment was tested and proven.

*This wasn't weeks or months—it was years of faithful service.* The text doesn't give us an exact timeline, but Elisha served Elijah through multiple significant events and ministries. The apprenticeship season can be long.

### What Elisha Was Learning

- **Servanthood**. True leadership begins with service

- **Obedience in small things**. Faithfulness in what seems insignificant

- **Patient endurance**. Waiting on God's timing, not forcing his own

- **Humility**. The contrast between his former wealth and current role as a servant

- **Dependence on God**. Watching Elijah's faith and learning to trust God's provision

*This echoes Jesus washing the disciples' feet—greatness in God's kingdom comes through serving others.*

### Masterclass in Prophetic Ministry

But Elisha's apprenticeship wasn't just about pouring water and humble service. He had a *front-row seat to witness God's power* through Elijah in dramatic ways:

#### Lesson 1: Confronting Injustice ([`1 Kings 21`](https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21.htm))

Elisha witnessed Elijah fearlessly confront King Ahab in the vineyard of the murdered Naboth. *He learned that God's call requires the courage to speak truth to power, no matter how corrupt or dangerous.* The prophetic ministry isn't about comfort—it's about standing for justice even when kings oppose you.

#### Lesson 2: The Reliability of God's Word ([`1 Kings 22`](https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22.htm))

Elisha saw the chillingly accurate fulfillment of Elijah's prophecy when King Ahab was killed in battle and dogs licked his blood—exactly as predicted. *He learned that God's Word of judgment is inescapable and absolutely reliable.* What God declares will come to pass.

#### Lesson 3: The Power of God's Presence ([`2 Kings 1`](https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1.htm))

Elisha saw Elijah call down fire from heaven to consume the soldiers of King Ahaziah who came to arrest him. *He learned that God is a jealous God who protects His messengers with terrifying power.* This wasn't just theory—Elisha witnessed the raw power of God defending His prophet.

This intense training—combining humble service with witnessing God's mighty acts—prepared Elisha for the ministry to come. He learned both humility and authority, both patience and boldness.

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    What makes the "apprenticeship season" so difficult? Why is it necessary?

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    How do we know when we're genuinely in Act 2 versus just avoiding Act 1?

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    What is your current "school of pouring water"?

*If you feel stuck in Act 2 right now, take heart—that's okay. Elisha was there for years. God is forging your character in the hidden places.*

## 3. Confirmation at the River (2 Kings 2:7-15)
**Pick Up the Mantle**. Private preparation meets public confirmation.

### Setting
The Jordan River, a place of divine transition and miraculous power—where Joshua led Israel into the Promised Land, where Naaman was healed, and now where Elisha's calling would be publicly confirmed.

### Journey to the Jordan
Elijah and Elisha travel from Gilgal toward the Jordan River. Along the way, groups of prophets (the "sons of the prophets"—members of prophetic guilds or communities) confirm that the LORD is about to take Elijah, heightening the drama.

### Test
After years of faithful service, Elisha proves his loyalty by refusing to leave his master's side. Three times he's given the option to stay behind; three times he refuses. "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you."

!!! quote "2 Kings 2:7-8, BSB"

    **7** Fifty men from the sons of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped by the Jordan. **8** Then Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.

Fifty prophets stand at a distance as witnesses. Elijah takes his cloak, rolls it up, and strikes the water—*directly echoing Moses parting the Red Sea ([`Exodus 14`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/14.htm))*. The water divides, and they cross on dry ground. This demonstrates that the God of the Exodus is still at work, and the cloak (like Moses' staff) is a symbol of God's authority working through His chosen prophet.

#### Request (vv. 9-10)

!!! quote "2 Kings 2:9-10, BSB"

    **9** When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken away from you?"

    "Please," Elisha replied, "let me inherit a double portion of your spirit."

    **10** "You have asked a difficult thing," Elijah said. "Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours. But if not, it will not be so."

When they cross over, Elijah asks what he can do for Elisha before being taken away. Elisha's response is profound: "Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit."

This is not a request for twice Elijah's power—it's the *request of a firstborn son for his inheritance* ([`Deuteronomy 21:17`](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-17.htm)). Elisha is asking to be recognized as Elijah's legitimate spiritual heir, equipped to carry on the ministry with the same Spirit of God that empowered Elijah. This acknowledges their deep father-son relationship.

Elijah responds: "You have asked a difficult thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours."

#### Divine Ascent (v. 11)

!!! quote "2 Kings 2:11, BSB"

    **11** As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.

Suddenly, a *chariot of fire with horses of fire* appears and separates them. Elijah goes up to heaven in a whirlwind.

**The Symbolism**.

- **Fire**. A common symbol of God's presence and power (burning bush, pillar of fire, Pentecost)

- **Chariots and horses**. The ultimate symbols of military might in the ancient world; God's *army* demonstrates His omnipotence

- **The whirlwind**.  In Canaanite religion, Baal was worshiped as the "rider of the clouds" and storm god. By taking Elijah in a whirlwind, *God demonstrates His absolute supremacy over all false gods*

Elijah doesn't die—he is taken directly into God's presence, a profound statement of God's power over life and death.

!!! quote "2 Kings 2:12-15, BSB"

    **12** Elisha saw this and cried out, "My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!" And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two.

    **13** He picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. **14** Then he took the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and struck the water. "Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" he asked. And when he had struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over.

    **15** When the sons of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, saw him, they said, "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha." And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.
Elisha returns to the Jordan and strikes the water with Elijah's cloak, crying out: "Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" This isn't doubt—it's a bold challenge and prayer, a moment of truth. He is publicly asking God to affirm his calling by showing the same power through him.

The fifty prophets watching from Jericho see this miracle and immediately recognize the transfer of authority. They declare: "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha," and they bow down before him. What began in a field with oxen and a plow is now confirmed at the river with power and authority.

## Application & Practical Living

Elisha's story provides a model for how we can respond to God's summons in our own lives—whether it's a call to a new career, a new level of integrity, or a new ministry.

### 1. Identify Your Call. What is God's "Mantle" for You Right Now?

Take time this week to ask the Holy Spirit to clarify His specific call on your life in this season. Is it a call to radical **integrity** at work? Unconditional **forgiveness** in a relationship? Sacrificial **generosity**? Intentional **discipleship**? 

*Be specific*—not "be a better Christian" but "reconcile with my brother" or "start that ministry to single mothers" or "leave this job that requires me to compromise my values."

Name it.

### 2. Embrace the Cost. What is Your "Plow" to Burn?

Answering God's summons requires decisively leaving something behind. Ask yourself: "What is the one comfort, habit, relationship, or source of security I need to let go of to walk forward in this calling?" 

Take a concrete, irreversible step to "burn that plow." Make it public. Make it costly. Make it final.

### 3. Accept the Apprenticeship. Where is Your "School of Pouring Water"?

Identify the daily grind in your life—the mundane, unglamorous, hidden work that feels thankless. This week, re-frame it. Instead of a burden, see it as the specific place God is forging your character and teaching you humility.

**Reframing Examples**.
- Boring commute → Time to pray and listen to God

- Changing diapers → Learning patience and selfless love

- Entry-level job → School of excellence and integrity

- Caring for aging parents → Honoring God through sacrifice

Ask God daily, "How can I be faithful in this hidden place today?"

## Challenges

### 1. Mantle Question (Reflection)
Set aside 15 quiet minutes. Ask God: "What is the primary 'mantle' of obedience you are calling me to in this season?" Listen, and write down what you sense God is saying.

**Supplementary Option**. Take a spiritual gifts assessment to better understand how God has equipped you. You can find one here: [Spiritual Gifts Survey](https://explorethebible.lifeway.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DOC-Spiritual-Gifts-Survey.pdf)

### 2. Plow-Burning Step (Action)
Identify one concrete, irreversible action you can take this week to demonstrate your commitment to that call. Do it, and tell a trusted friend for accountability.

**Supplementary Option**. Read about another person who left things behind to follow God (e.g., Abraham in Genesis 12, Peter and Andrew in Matthew 4, or the rich young ruler in Mark 10).

### 3. Water-Pouring Perspective (Attitude)
Identify your main "grind." Each day before you begin, offer a one-sentence prayer: "God, thank you for this place of preparation. Teach me humility and faithfulness here today."

### 4. "Next Step" Action (Optional)
**Identify**. Write down one specific area (Family, Work, Church, Community) where you believe God is inviting you to join His work right now.

**Express**. Speak with a pastor, small group leader, or trusted mentor this week about your spiritual gifts and where you see God at work, asking for opportunities to get involved.

## Supplementary Discussion Questions

These additional questions can deepen group discussion or personal reflection:

### On the Call (Act 1)

- Who has been an example to you of obedience to God's voice?

- What obstacles can prevent us from responding to God's leadership with all-in obedience?

- Why do you think God often calls us when we're comfortable and successful?

- What made Elisha's response so radical? What would a "safe" response have looked like?

### On the Apprenticeship (Act 2)

- What makes the "apprenticeship season" so difficult? Why is it necessary?

- How do we know when we're genuinely in Act 2 versus just avoiding Act 1?

- What is your current "school of pouring water"?

- How has God's presence made a difference as you've served Him?

- What might be the consequences of trying to serve God apart from His presence?

### On the Confirmation (Act 3)
- What are some ways God reassures us of His presence and power?
- How does God empower believers today to do His work?
- What practical steps can we take to rely more on God's power as we serve Him?

## Extra Context & Background

For teachers or those wanting deeper understanding:

### Historical Context
The events of 1 Kings 19 follow the climax of Elijah's ministry on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18), where he defeated the prophets of Baal. Following this victory, Queen Jezebel threatened his life, causing Elijah to flee into the wilderness to Mount Horeb (Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai—where Moses received the Law). 

It is there that God, after speaking to the discouraged prophet in the "still small voice," gives him three commands: anoint Hazael as king of Aram, Jehu as king of Israel, and Elisha as his own successor (1 Kings 19:9-18). The calling of Elisha happens immediately after this divine encounter.

### Cultural Notes

- **Twelve yoke of oxen**. This indicates substantial wealth—not a small family farm but a significant agricultural operation with servants and workers

- **The mantle/cloak**. More than clothing, it was a symbol of prophetic authority and power. The secular phrase "pass the mantle" originates from this story

- **Kissing parents goodbye**. Not reluctance but proper respect—formal farewells were culturally important

- **Elijah's rhetorical question**. "What have I done to you?" was his way of clarifying that the call came from God, not man. Elisha's ultimate service was to God

- **The feast**. In ancient households (including extended family and servants), this was both farewell and celebration

- **Sons of the prophets**. Not biological sons but members of prophetic guilds or communities studying under a senior prophet

### Theological Connections

- **Jesus' teaching**. "No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God" ([`Luke 9:62`](https://biblehub.com/luke/9-62.htm))

- **Abraham's call**. Like Elisha, Abraham was called to leave his homeland and security ([`Genesis 12:1-3`](https://biblehub.com/genesis/12.htm#1))

- **Jesus washing feet**. The apprenticeship of service echoes Jesus' teaching that greatness comes through serving ([`John 13`](https://biblehub.com/john/13.htm))

- **Moses and the Red Sea**. The parting of the Jordan deliberately echoes the Exodus, showing continuity of God's power

- **Firstborn inheritance**. The "double portion" ([`Deuteronomy 21:17`](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-17.htm)) was the legal right of the firstborn son

## Addressing Common Objections

**"But I'm not sure it's really God calling me..."**  
That's why Application #1 is about listening and confirming. Seek wise counsel, test it against Scripture, and look for peace in your spirit. God's voice becomes clearer as we practice listening.

**"What if I burn my plow and it was just my own idea?"**  
God honors sincere obedience. If you're genuinely seeking Him and step out in faith, He will redirect you if needed. The greater danger is staying paralyzed by fear of making a mistake.

**"Isn't keeping options open just being wise?"**  
There's a difference between wisdom and hedging your bets against God. Elisha could have kept one yoke of oxen "just in case." Instead, he made his commitment irreversible. Radical obedience requires burning the escape routes.

## Closing Reflection

Today we've seen one of the most dramatic succession stories in the Bible. Elisha's call was not a quiet suggestion; it was a life-interrupting summons. His response was not hesitant; it was a decisive, all-in commitment that involved a burnt plow and a farewell feast. He then shadowed his mentor for years, refusing to leave his side, pouring water on his hands while witnessing God's mighty power. He knew that the power for the ministry ahead did not come from the mantle he would inherit, but from the God who was calling him.

Elisha's story isn't just history—it's a pattern. Your call may look different, but your response should look the same: immediate, costly, and irreversible.

### Unrefusable Offer

We are constantly bombarded with invitations—car dealerships, credit card offers, jury summons. Most are easy to dismiss. But what if you received a personal invitation from someone you deeply admired—a world leader, a brilliant artist, or a legendary athlete—to come and be their personal apprentice? That's an invitation you wouldn't just consider; you would drop everything for it.

*That's exactly what God offers us.* Not an invitation from a human mentor, but from the Creator of the universe to join Him in His redemptive work. It's not a piece of junk mail we can toss aside. It is a personal, life-altering summons.

Elisha's story reminds us that God's invitation to join Him is the most important one we will ever receive. It demands a response. It requires that we are willing to leave our own "plows" behind, to depend not on our own strength but on His, and to boldly ask for His presence as we step into the work He has for us. 

*God is still extending that invitation today*—in our families, in our workplaces, in our church, and in our communities. 

The question isn't whether you're adequate for God's call. The question is whether you'll demonstrate your devotion through immediate action.

*Now go burn your plow.*

## Closing Prayer

> Father,
>
> We praise You as the God who calls. Thank you that You don't leave us to wander aimlessly, but that you have a specific, holy purpose for each of us. We thank you for your authority, that when You issue a summons, You also provide the strength to follow.
>
> We confess our hesitation. Unlike Elisha, we so often debate our adequacy. We make excuses, we cling to our security, and we keep a 'Plan B' in case Your plan doesn't work out. Forgive us for our fear and for our failure to trust You with radical devotion.
>
> Lord, we ask for a spirit like Elisha's. Grant us the courage to take immediate and irreversible action—to **burn the plows** that hold us back. Give us the humility to embrace the hidden seasons of apprenticeship, the 'school of pouring water,' where you forge our character. And make us ready, Lord, to one day **pick up the mantle** of influence You have prepared for us, not for our glory, but for Yours.
>
> Help us this week to walk in the specific obedience You are calling us to.
>
> In the name of Jesus, who perfectly answered Your call, Amen.
