## Core Message

Integrity is a consistent, Christ-centered posture that responds to hostility with blessing, maintains a clear conscience, and is always ready to defend the hope within with gentleness and respect.

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

> If you had a hidden camera follow you for 24 hours, what "secret ingredient" of your character would be most obvious? What "ingredient" would be surprisingly missing?

> Have you ever been in a situation where doing the "right thing" or speaking the "truth" actually cost you something—a friendship, a job, or your reputation? Was it worth the cost?

**Synthesis**. Integrity is often defined as "doing the right thing when no one is looking." But Peter takes it further: integrity is "doing the right thing when everyone is looking and they don't like what they see." Today we look at how to build a character so stable that it remains "above reproach" even in a hostile culture.

## Internal Culture of Integrity (1 Pet. 3:8–12)

### 1 Peter 3:8–12, BSB

> **8** Finally, all of you, be like-minded, sympathetic, love as brothers, be tenderhearted and humble. **9** Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. **10** For, "Whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech. **11** He must turn from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it. **12** For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and His ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."

### Five Marks of Integrity (Discussion:Mind)

> In verse 8, Peter lists five qualities (like-minded, sympathetic, brotherly love, tenderhearted, humble). Which of these is most missing in our current cultural "integrity"? Why is "humility" essential for "like-mindedness"?

**Relational Character**. Integrity isn't just about "not lying"; it's about how we "treat each other." You can't be "like-minded" if you are full of "self-importance." Humility is the soil in which all other relational virtues grow. Integrity starts in the community of believers before it can be a witness to the world.

### Blessing instead of Retaliation (Discussion:Mind)

> Verse 9 gives a radical command: "Do not repay evil with evil... but with blessing." Why is it so hard to respond with "blessing" when we are "insulted"? How does our "calling" to inherit a blessing change our response to insults?

**Gospel-Powered Response**. Our natural instinct is to "even the score." But if we believe we have already "inherited a blessing" from God, we don't have to "fight" for our own honor. Integrity is the ability to stay calm and kind when you are being attacked, because your value is already secure in Christ. We "bless" because we are "blessed."

### Tongue Check (Reflection:Heart)

> Is your tongue "kept from evil" and your lips from "deceitful speech" (v.10)? Are you "seeking peace" or "seeking to be right"? Where in your life right now is your "integrity" failing the "retaliation test"?

*Transition*. Peter has shown us what integrity looks like in relationships. Now he shows us the "anchor" that makes this integrity possible.

## Sanctifying Christ as Lord (1 Pet. 3:13–15a)

### 1 Peter 3:13–15a, BSB

> **13** Who will harm you if you are zealous for what is good? **14** But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. "Do not fear their threats; do not be frightened." **15** But in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord.

### Fear vs. Sanctification (Discussion:Mind)

> Peter quotes Isaiah 8:12–13: "Do not fear their threats... But in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord." What is the relationship between "fearing people" and "sanctifying Christ"? How does making Christ "Lord" in your heart kill the "fear" of threats?

**The Bigger Reality**. Integrity fails when we are "frightened." If we fear what people can do to us, we will compromise our character to protect ourselves. "Sanctifying Christ as Lord" means making Him the "biggest thing" in our internal world. When Christ is truly Lord, the "threats" of men become small in comparison to His sovereignty. Integrity is "fearing God" so much that you "fear nothing else."

### Suffering for What is Right (Discussion:Mind)

> Why does Peter say we are "blessed" if we "suffer for what is right"? How does this challenge our definition of a "blessed life"?

**Ultimate Vindication**. In the world’s economy, "blessing" means "avoiding suffering." In God’s economy, "blessing" is "participation in Christ's sufferings" (v.18). Integrity means being more concerned with "doing right" than "feeling good." The "blessing" is the "clear conscience" (v.16) and the "eyes of the Lord" (v.12) watching over us.

### Anchor Check (Reflection:Heart)

> Is Christ truly "sanctified as Lord" in the "closet of your heart," or are you still "fearing the threats" of your coworkers, neighbors, or peers? What is the one thing you are most "frightened" of losing?

*Transition*. If Christ is our internal anchor, we are now ready to engage the world with our "defense."

## Defending the Hope with Gentleness (1 Pet. 3:15b–17)

### 1 Peter 3:15b–17, BSB

> **15** Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you the reason for the hope that is in you. But do this with gentleness and respect, **16** keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. **17** For it is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.

### Reason for the Hope (Discussion:Mind)

> Peter assumes people will "ask you the reason for the hope that is in you." What does this imply about the "visible integrity" of a Christian? If no one is asking you for a "reason," what might that say about your "hope"?

**Visible Difference**. Our integrity should be "loud enough" that it provokes curiosity. If we live exactly like the world—fearful, greedy, and retaliatory—no one will ever ask why we are "different." The "defense" (*apologia*) is not a "debate"; it is an "explanation" for a life that doesn't make sense without Jesus.

### Gentleness and Respect (Discussion:Mind)

> Why does Peter insist on "gentleness and respect" when we are giving our "defense"? How does a "harsh" or "disrespectful" defense actually undermine our "integrity"?

**Medium as the Message**. You can't "defend the Gospel" with "the weapons of the world." If we win an argument but lose our "integrity" (by being rude or arrogant), we have failed. Our "gentleness" is the proof that we trust God to "vindiate us" (v.16). Integrity means our "manner" matches our "message."

### Clear Conscience (Reflection:Heart)

> Do you have a "clear conscience" (v.16) before God and men? Is there a "hidden area" of your life that would "ashame" you if it were made public? Are you "better" at "doing good" than "defending your rights"?

## Closing

### The Mirror of Integrity

In this series, we've looked at character as a **fortress** (Contentment) and an **overflow** (Generosity). Integrity is like a **mirror**. It reflects Christ to the world, but if the mirror is "cracked" by hypocrisy or "clouded" by fear, the image of Christ is distorted. Integrity is "polishing the mirror" so that our "good conduct in Christ" (v.16) is what people see.

### Decision (Will)

**Sanctifying the Center**. Will you commit this week to making Christ the "Lord of your heart" in the one area where you are most "frightened" of being "different"?

**Tongue Taming**. Will you commit to "keeping your tongue from evil" and "repaying insult with blessing" in your most difficult relationship?

**Preparation for Hope**. Will you spend time this week "preparing your reason" for the hope you have, so that you are "always ready" to speak with gentleness?

### Challenges (Practice)

**Blessing Response**. Identify one person who "gets on your nerves" or has "insulted" you. This week, find a way to "bless" them—a kind word, a helpful act, or a sincere prayer.

**Conscience Audit**. Take 15 minutes of silence this week to ask God: *"Is there any 'deceitful speech' or 'evil conduct' in me that is clouding my conscience?"* Repent and make it right where necessary.

**Apologia Prep**. Write down a 2-minute "reason for my hope." If someone asked you tomorrow, "Why are you so different?", what would you say? Focus on Christ, not yourself.

**Memory Verse**. 1 Peter 3:15. *But in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you the reason for the hope that is in you. But do this with gentleness and respect.*

### Prayer

> Father, we confess that we have often cared more about "reputation" than "integrity." We have "repaid evil with evil" and "feared the threats" of men more than we have "feared You." Our mirrors are cracked and clouded.
>
> Sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts. Anchor our souls so deeply in Your blessing that we no longer need to "fight for our rights" or "even the score." Give us the courage to "suffer for what is right" and the "gentleness" to speak of our hope.
>
> May our conduct be so "above reproach" that even those who speak maliciously against us are "ashamed of their slander." Let our lives be a "reason" for others to seek the hope that can only be found in Jesus.
>
> To the One who suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, be glory forever. Amen.
