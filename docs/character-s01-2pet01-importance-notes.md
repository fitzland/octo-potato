# The Importance of Character

2 Peter 1:1-11, BSB

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

When you think about what our culture celebrates most—talent, success, fame, influence—where does character rank? Why do you think that is?

*You do you* is a popular phrase people use to give themselves and others permission to do and act in any way that feels best to them. The problem with this mindset is that we're flawed human beings; we don't always act in the best way. The only way we can live rightly is to live the way God calls us to live—embracing the character traits that reflect Christ.

### Series Overview

For six weeks, we'll be in a series called **Character Counts**. 

- **Session 1**. Importance of Character (2 Peter 1:1-11) – Equipped for Christlike character
- **Session 2**. Godliness (1 Timothy 4:6-16) – Point others to Christ
- **Session 3**. Humility (Philippians 2:1-11) – Consider the needs of others
- **Session 4**. Contentment (Philippians 4:10-20) – Find satisfaction in Christ
- **Session 5**. Generosity (2 Corinthians 8:1-9) – Give from what God has given us
- **Session 6**. Integrity (1 Peter 3:8-17) – Live consistently with our confession

### Historical Context

Peter wrote this (2nd) letter around AD 64-67, knowing his death was imminent under Nero's brutal persecution. But the church also faced an internal threat: false teachers who denied Christ's return and used that as license for immoral living. 

Peter emphasizes the importance of *growing* in the faith and knowledge of Jesus Christ. He highlighted the certainty of Christ’s return and the coming judgment, urging believers to live *holy* and *godly* lives.

Peter could have written about many things, but he chose to write about *character*. 

Why? Because when everything else is stripped away, our character is what testifies to Christ. 

### Modern Context

Christian influence on American culture has declined in recent years. Consider these statistics:

- Christian identification dropped over 10% from 2007 to now
- Non-religious Americans describe Christians with these words:
	+ Hypocritical 
	+ Judgmental 
	+ Self-Righteous 
	+ Arrogant 
	+ Unforgiving
- 29% of religiously unaffiliated Americans say Christians represent Jesus' values and teachings *not at all*

Unfortunately, they're not always wrong. When we publicly proclaim allegiance to Christ, it is essential that our character matches the One we profess to follow. Truly, *character counts*.

### Core Message

God equips us for Christlike character.

## 1. God Equips Us

God has already provided us with everything we need to live a life that reflects His character.

### 2 Peter 1:1-4, BSB

> **1** Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,
> To those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
>
> **2** May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
>
> **3** His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us to His own glory and excellence, **4** by which He has granted to us His precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.

### Context & Insights

-	**Peter's Journey**. Before looking at Peter's teaching, we need to understand that Peter experienced the same character transformation he's writing about. He thought himself above being disloyal to Jesus even though others might be (Matt. 26:33). But after boldly stating he would never betray Jesus, within hours he denied Jesus three times and declared he never knew Him (vv. 69-75). Decades later, he's writing with authority about Christlike character. What changed? The greatness and goodness of Jesus drew Peter toward transformed character.

-   **Faith of Equal Standing**. Peter addresses believers who share the same faith as the apostles. The word *obtained* (lachousin) implies this faith was *allotted* or *granted* to them, not earned through merit. All believers, regardless of background or spiritual maturity, are on level ground at the foot of the cross. **Illustration**. *Like citizens receiving equal rights not through merit but through birth or adoption.*

-   **Multiplied Grace and Peace**. These aren't static, but rather dynamic gifts that increase in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. This *knowledge* (epignōsis) is not merely intellectual assent but a deep, personal, and experiential relationship—a growing intimacy that transforms. **Illustration**. *Imagine a friendship that deepens over time, where knowing more about the person leads to greater trust and peace in their presence.*

-   **Divine Power & Provision**. God's divine power has *granted to us all things* that pertain to life and godliness. We are not left to our own devices. God has equipped us with everything we need—spiritually and practically—to live a life that honors Him. This promise echoes Ephesians 1:3, where Paul declares that God has *blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing*. The provision is complete and abundant.

-   **Precious & Great Promises**. These promises are the mechanism through which we become partakers of the divine nature. We are enabled to share in His moral attributes—His holiness, love, justice, and purity. This is God's antidote to the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire. **Illustration**. *Think of a child who inherited characteristics from their parents. As believers, we are adopted into God's family, and we inherit aspects of His character.*

### Equal Standing

> Peter says we have obtained a *faith of equal standing* through Christ's righteousness. 
>
> What are the implications for how we view ourselves and other believers within the church?

**No Spiritual Pride**. There's no *upper class* of super-spiritual Christians. The newest believer has the same access to God, the same standing before Him, and the same precious faith as the most mature saint or even the apostles themselves. 

**Encouragement in Our Own Standing**. We don't need to feel inferior or compare ourselves to others. Our faith isn't second-rate or less valuable than anyone else's. We have direct access to God and everything we need for life and godliness.

**Unity Across Differences**. Whether we're young or old, rich or poor, educated or uneducated, from different ethnic backgrounds or church traditions—we all share equally in this faith. Our unity is based on Christ's righteousness, not our own achievements or backgrounds.

**Mutual Respect and Humility**. We should treat every believer with dignity and respect, recognizing that God has given them the same precious gift He's given us. No believer should be dismissed, marginalized, or treated as *less than*.

### God's Promises

> Verses 3-4 speak of God's *divine power* and *precious and very great promises* that enable us to live a godly life and become partakers of the divine nature. 
>
> What specific promises of God encourage you most in your pursuit of a Christlike character?

**"I will never leave you nor forsake you" (Hebrews 13:5)**. God's constant presence means we're never alone in our struggle to grow. He's with us in every moment of temptation, every failure, and every small victory.

**"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:9)**. We don't have to be strong enough on our own. God's grace meets us exactly where we are, and His power works best through our weaknesses.

**"He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion" (Philippians 1:6)**. God finishes what He starts. Our spiritual growth isn't dependent on our ability to maintain momentum—God Himself is committed to completing the work He began in us.

**"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us" (1 John 1:9)**. When we fail (and we will), we have immediate access to forgiveness and cleansing. We don't have to wallow in guilt or give up—we can confess, receive forgiveness, and continue growing.

**"No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind... God will provide a way out" (1 Corinthians 10:13)**. We're not alone in our struggles, and God always provides an escape route from temptation. Character growth is possible because God makes it possible.

### Reflection (Heart)

> **Self-Assessment**. Do I truly believe that God has granted me all things that pertain to life and godliness? OR, do I feel that I lack the resources or ability to live the Christian life?

*Transition*. God has done His part, granting us everything needed for life and godliness through His power and promises. But Peter doesn't stop there; he immediately calls us to actively respond to this divine provision.

## 2. Make Every Effort

Our active pursuit of Christlike virtues leads to a fruitful and impactful spiritual life.

### 2 Peter 1:5-8, BSB

> **5** For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, **6** and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, **7** and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. **8** For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

### Context & Insights

-   **"Make Every Effort"**. Peter shifts from divine provision to human responsibility. The phrase *make every effort* (spoudēn) conveys diligence and urgency. The word *supplement* (epichorēgēsate) indicates we are to generously, abundantly, even *extravagantly* supply these virtues to our faith. This isn't about grudging obedience or minimal effort but lavish, joyful investment in our spiritual growth. God provides the equipment, we must put in the effort.

-   **Ladder of Virtues**. A progressive list, where each virtue builds upon the previous one. It's not a checklist, but process of growth.
    -   **Faith**. (pistis) starting point, trust in God.
    -   **Virtue**. (aretē) moral excellence; living a life consistent with one's confession.
    -   **Knowledge**. (gnōsis) not just factual knowledge, but practical wisdom and discernment.
    -   **Self-Control**. (egkrateia) mastery over one's desires and impulses.
    -   **Steadfastness**. (hypomonē) patient endurance in the face of trials and opposition.
    -   **Godliness** (eusebeia) reverent attitude towards God that manifests in all aspects of life.
    -   **Brotherly Affection**. (philadelphia) love for fellow believers, a sense of family.
    -   **Love** (agapē) highest form of selfless, sacrificial love, encompassing all other virtues. The capstone.

-   **Building Virtues**. Consider this progression: You exercise self-control over your anger in a difficult relationship → that self-control enables perseverance (steadfastness) through ongoing challenges → perseverance cultivates godliness as you learn to honor God even when it's hard → godliness opens the door to brotherly affection as you see that person through God's eyes → and brotherly affection matures into agape love that seeks their highest good regardless of how they treat you.

-   **Avoiding Unfruitfulness**. When these qualities are present and increasing, they prevent believers from being *ineffective or unfruitful*. Ineffective implies a lack of impact, while unfruitful suggests a failure to produce the results expected of a healthy tree. **Illustration**. *A well-maintained garden, consistently watered and weeded, produces abundant fruit. A neglected garden, despite fertile soil, yields little. Our spiritual lives are similar; diligent cultivation leads to fruitfulness.*

### Make Every Effort

> In what specific areas of your life do you feel the need to make every effort to cultivate these virtues right now?

**Self-Control**. Perhaps with eating habits, screen time, spending, anger, or words spoken in frustration. Many struggle with mastering desires and impulses in our instant-gratification culture.

**Steadfastness/Perseverance**. Enduring through a difficult work situation, health challenges, relational conflict, or financial pressure without giving up or compromising faith.

**Brotherly Affection**. Showing genuine family-like care for believers who are different from us, difficult to love, or outside our natural social circle.

**Knowledge**. Growing in practical wisdom for decision-making, parenting, navigating cultural issues, or discerning truth from error in a confusing world.

### How Virtues Build
> The list of virtues culminates in love. How does growing in the preceding virtues (knowledge, self-control, steadfastness, godliness, brotherly affection) prepare us to truly live out agape love?

**Knowledge provides direction**. We need wisdom to know *how* to love well. Without knowledge, our love might actually enable sin or avoid difficult truth. Knowledge helps us love in ways that genuinely help others.

**Self-control enables sacrifice**. Agape love requires putting others first, which demands self-control over our own preferences, convenience, and comfort. Without self-control, love becomes conditional—only when it's easy.

**Steadfastness makes love enduring**. Real love doesn't quit when it gets hard. Steadfastness trains us to keep loving through disappointment, betrayal, or when love isn't returned. It makes our love reliable and trustworthy.

**Godliness keeps love God-centered**. Without godliness, our love can become people-pleasing or codependency. Godliness ensures our love flows from reverence for God and seeks what honors Him, not just what makes others happy.

**Brotherly affection makes love personal**. Philadelphia (brotherly love) teaches us to see believers as true brothers and sisters. This familial bond prepares us to extend agape even to those outside the family—because we've learned to love sacrificially within it first.

**The virtues together create mature love**. Each virtue addresses a different weakness in our natural attempts to love. Together, they mature us into people capable of the kind of love Christ demonstrated—wise, sacrificial, enduring, God-honoring, and unconditional.

### Reflection (Heart)

> **Personal Growth**. Looking at Peter's list of virtues, which one do you find most challenging to grow in, and why? What might be hindering your progress in that area?

*Transition*. We've seen the call to diligent effort in developing Christlike character, and the promise that such growth prevents ineffectiveness. But Peter also warns of the spiritual dangers of neglecting this pursuit, impacting our assurance and witness.

## 3. Character Confirms

A life marked by Christlike character is a visible testament to our transformed relationship with God, leading to assurance and eternal reward.

### 2 Peter 1:9-11, BSB

> **9** For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. **10** Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. **11** For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

### Context & Insights

-   **Spiritual Nearsightedness & Blindness**. Peter issues a stern warning: those who lack and fail to grow in these virtues are nearsighted or blind. They have forgotten or lost sight of the spiritual reality of their cleansing from past sins and the new life they have in Christ. Their short-sightedness prevents them from seeing the long-term impact of their spiritual stagnation. **Illustration**. *My reminds me of the recent surgery, and my past condition. I shouldn't forget the preciousness of my new health.*

-   **Peter's Urgent Awareness**. Peter uses the metaphor of putting off my tent to describe his coming death—a beautiful picture of the temporary nature of our earthly bodies compared to our eternal dwelling. Peter knew death was near, and he wanted believers anchored in what truly endures.

-   **Confirming Your Calling & Election**. Peter's command to be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election is not about *earning* salvation, but about *demonstrating* its reality. It's about living in a way that provides assurance—both to oneself and to others—that one is genuinely a child of God. **Illustration**. *A tree is known by its fruit. Our character confirms our spiritual reality.*

-   **Rich Entrance**. The promise for those who diligently pursue Christlike character is entrance into the eternal kingdom. It speaks of an abundant and honored welcome, not merely a barely-there admission. 

### Spiritual Nearsightedness

> What are some ways a believer might practically forget their cleansing or become spiritually nearsighted in today's world?

**Getting Comfortable with Sin**. When we stop being grieved by our own sin or amazed by grace, we've forgotten how lost we once were and how much we've been forgiven. We begin to treat grace casually.

**Living for Immediate Gratification**. Spiritual nearsightedness is focusing only on what's right in front of us—comfort, pleasure, success, reputation—while losing sight of eternity and God's purposes. We can see this week but not the eternal kingdom.

**Comparing Ourselves to Others**. When we measure our spirituality by how we stack up against other people rather than against Christ's standard, we forget that we all equally needed cleansing. Pride creeps in.

**Neglecting Spiritual Disciplines**. When we stop regularly engaging with Scripture, prayer, and worship, we lose perspective on who God is and who we were without Him. The memory of our cleansing fades.

**Focusing on External Religion**. Going through religious motions without heart transformation makes us forget that Christianity is about being cleansed and made new, not just performing religious duties.

### Confirm Your Calling

> How does diligently growing in Christlike character confirm your calling and election without implying that we earn our salvation?

**Evidence, Not Earning**. Our character doesn't *cause* our salvation, but it *confirms* it. Just as smoke confirms fire, growing Christlike character confirms God's saving work in us. 

**Assurance Through Fruit**. When we see ourselves growing in these virtues, it gives us confidence that God is genuinely at work in our lives. It's the difference between *wondering*: Am I really saved? and *knowing*: Yes, because God is changing me."

**Witness to Others**. Our character confirms our calling not just to ourselves but to the watching world. When people see authentic transformation—real love, self-control, godliness—it testifies that our faith is genuine, not just empty words.

**Difference Between Root and Fruit**. Faith is the root (how we're saved); character is the fruit (evidence we're saved). 

**God's Part and Our Part**. God does the saving and provides everything we need (Section 1). Our diligent pursuit of character (Section 2) demonstrates we've truly received what God has given. Our effort doesn't save us; it shows we're saved.

### Reflection (Heart)

> **Honest Assessment**. Am I demonstrating the kind of Christlike character that confirms my calling and election to those around me? What changes do I need to make to ensure my life points clearly to my relationship with Christ?

## Closing

### Decision (Will)

**Responding to Grace**. Given that God has already provided all things that pertain to life and godliness, will you commit to making every effort to cultivate the virtues Peter lists?

**Confirming Your Calling**. In light of the promise that diligent growth confirms your calling and election, will you actively pursue Christlike character as a demonstration of your relationship with Christ?

### Challenges (Practice)

1. **Daily Virtue Check**. Reflect on one of the virtues from 2 Peter 1:5-7. Pray for God's help to grow in it, and identify a specific opportunity to practice it.

2. **Promise Application**. Choose one of God's precious and very great promises (v. 4) that resonates with you. Consider how believing that promise empowers you to escape worldly corruption and pursue godliness.

3. **Spiritual Vision Check**. Take time this week to review the account of your salvation. Thank God for cleansing you from your former sins and reflect on how your life has changed since then. 

4. **Memory Verse**. Memorize 2 Peter 1:3 – "His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us to His own glory and excellence."
