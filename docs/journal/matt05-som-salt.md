# Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:14-16)

## Core Passage (Berean Standard Bible):

> **Matthew 5:14-16**. You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

## How do we understand *Light*

### Literal Light. 

In the ancient world, light was vital. Darkness meant danger, fear, and limited activity. 

Artificial light was precious and often expensive, making it a symbol of prosperity and a useful resource for safety, security and work. 

Think of oil lamps, candles, and torches.

### Figurative Light. 

*Truth & Knowledge*. Light exposes, reveals, and dispels ignorance and error.

*Goodness & Righteousness*. Light contrasts with the darkness of sin and evil. It represents moral purity and upright living.

*Guidance & Direction*. Light illuminates the path, showing the way forward.

*Hope & Salvation*. Light overcomes the darkness of despair and death.

*Revelation & Understanding*.

*Divine Presence & Glory*. Light is often associated with God's presence and holiness.

## Greek Words for **Light**.

φῶς (phos). This is the primary word for *light* used in Matthew 5:14 & 16. 

- It encompasses both literal light and its figurative meanings: illumination, understanding, and spiritual truth.

- Usage in Ancient Times. Literally used for the light of the sun, moon, stars, and lamps. Figuratively, it represented life, reason, truth, moral purity, prosperity, and salvation.

λύχνος (lychnos). This word is used for *lamp* in Matthew 5:15. 

- It refers specifically to a container with a wick that burns oil, providing artificial light. 

- This brings the metaphor of the gospel light to a more personal setting, shining on all in the house.

## Breakdown of the Passage

The key components: affirmation, negative examples, and positive purpose. Let's expand on that a bit:

### Affirmation (Verse 14a).

> You are the light of the world.

This is a declarative statement, not a suggestion. It establishes the identity of Jesus' followers as inherently light-bearing.

The *world* is the sphere where this light is to function. It's not just within the church or religious community, but in all aspects of life: work, family, social interactions, etc.

This can be **empowering**, reminding believers of their inherent potential, but also **daunting**, highlighting the responsibility to live up to that calling.

### Negative Examples (Verse 14b-15).

> A city on a hill cannot be hidden... Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket...

These are illustrations of the absurdity of hiding light. They underscore the inherent purpose of light: **to be seen**.

**City on a hill**. A city perched high on a hill is naturally visible from a distance. 

- The implication is that a true Christian life, lived according to kingdom principles, will inevitably attract attention. It will be visible.

**Lamp under a basket**. Lighting a lamp and then covering it up completely defeats the purpose. A *basket* (Greek: modios) was a dry measuring container for grain, often a bushel basket. The light cannot fulfill its destiny when hidden. 

- The implication is that Christians may hide their light because they do not want to be seen, or are afraid of being seen.

**Common Thread**. Both examples highlight the intentionality of hiding. It's not an accident; it's a deliberate act that goes against the very nature of light.

### Positive Purpose (Verse 16).

> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

This is the core instruction: actively and intentionally let your light shine.

**Let your light shine before men**. This emphasizes visibility and proclamation. It's not about drawing attention to ourselves, but to purposefully display the light of Christ.

**Good deeds**. These are the manifestation of the light. It's not just about words; it's about actions that reflect God's love and character. These deeds flow naturally from a life transformed by the gospel.

**Glorify your Father in heaven**. This is the ultimate goal. The purpose of our good deeds is not self-promotion but to bring honor and praise to God. Our actions should point people to Him, not to ourselves. To *glorify* is to increase appreciation of something; to show respect and admiration for.

### Implications & Connections

The *house* in verse 15 connects to the *world* in verse 14. 

- The house is the immediate environment of our lives, where our light should shine brightly. 

- The world is the larger context where our collective light makes a global impact.

There's a subtle but important distinction between being light and letting your light shine. 

- We are light because of our relationship with Christ, but we must actively choose to let that light shine through our actions and words.

The passage is not just about individual piety; it's about collective witness. The city on a hill is a community of believers whose combined light illuminates the world.

## Cross-References

> **John 1:4-9**. In Him was life, and that life was the light of men. This light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it... The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. 

- Jesus as the ultimate source of light

> **John 8:12**. Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.'

- Jesus is the light

> **John 12:35-36**. Jesus answered, “For a little while longer, the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light. 

- We need to stay in the light

> **Ephesians 5:8**. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light.

- We are transformed

> **Philippians 2:15**. so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and perverse generation, in which you shine as lights in the world... 

- We are to be different

> **1 Peter 2:9**. But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

- We are called to proclaim the gospel.

## Basic Teaching of Jesus Regarding Light

Jesus teaches that His followers are the light of the world. This isn't just a suggestion; it's a statement of identity and responsibility. We don't create the light, but we reflect it. Because Jesus is the light of the world, we are to walk in his light.

## What are some ways that we let our LIGHT shine?

- *Living Out Kingdom Values*. Demonstrating love, compassion, forgiveness, justice, and humility in our daily lives.

- *Sharing the Gospel*. Proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ through our words and actions.

- *Serving Others*. Meeting the needs of those around us, both physically and spiritually.

- *Standing for Truth*. Upholding biblical principles and speaking out against injustice and evil.

- *Being Authentic & Transparent*. Living with integrity and honesty, allowing others to see Christ in us.

## What keeps us from letting our LIGHT shine?

- *Sin & Unrepentance*. Unconfessed sin dims our light and hinders our ability to reflect Christ.

- *Fear of Man*. Worrying about what others think can lead us to compromise our values and hide our light.

- *Worldliness*. Becoming too attached to material possessions, worldly pleasures, and societal approval.

- *Self-Righteousness*. Focusing on our own perceived goodness rather than acknowledging our need for God's grace.

- *Complacency & Apathy*. Losing our passion for God and His mission in the world.

## Are we really begin **Light** when...

- *Legalism*. Imposing rigid rules and regulations on others, creating barriers instead of inviting them into relationship with Christ.

- *Judgmentalism*. Condemning others instead of showing compassion and understanding.

- *Hypocrisy*. Saying one thing but doing another, creating a false image of Christianity.

- *Pride*. Boasting about our own accomplishments and spiritual maturity, alienating those who are struggling.

- *Divisiveness*. Creating unnecessary divisions and conflicts within the church or community.

## Context

Jesus is speaking to His disciples, those who have committed to following Him.

## Application

- Reflect on how you can better reflect Christ's light in your own sphere of influence.

- Discuss the different ways "good deeds" can manifest in contemporary life. (e.g., acts of service, advocacy for justice, ethical business practices, creative arts, etc.).

- Address the potential for misunderstanding the concept of "good deeds." (e.g., doing good deeds for selfish motives, equating good deeds with earning salvation).

- Explore the tension between humility and letting your light shine. (How can we avoid pride while still being visible witnesses for Christ?)

- Brainstorm practical ways to "let your light shine" in specific contexts. (e.g., at work, at school, in the community, online).
