# Light of the World (Matthew 5:14-16)

## Passage

!!! quote "Matthew 5:14-16"

    You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

## Why do we need to be LIGHT?

### The world is a *DARK* place.

**Depravity**. We are spiritually depraved and we prefer our sinful ways to God's ways. 

> [Ephesians 4:18](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm). They are darkended in their understanding, alienated from the life of God.

> [Genesis 6:5](https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm). Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was altogether evil all the time.

**Deception**. We like to think we are good; we don't see our sin. We blame others and external sources rather than taking responsibility. 

> [Proverbs 21:2](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-2.htm). Every path of a man is right in his own eyes, but the LORD weigns the heart.

> [Isaiah 5:20-21](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-20.htm). Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.

**Discovered**. Jesus exposed the darkness, even where people thought they had light (hypocrisy). [Boice](#). Comparing the brightness of flashlights in the daylight shows their insignificance.

> [John 3:19](https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm). The light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil. 

**Two Responses**. When confronted with the darkness, people have two options: 

1. **Reject** Christ and hate Him for exposing them.
2. **Receive** Christ and turn to Him for cleansing and righteousness.

## What are some of the meanings of LIGHT?

### Literal. 

Think: oil lamps, candles, and torches.

In biblical times, light was a big deal. Darkness meant danger, fear, and limited activity. Artificial light was precious and expensive, making it a symbol of prosperity and a useful resource for safety, security and work. 

### Figurative. 

**Truth & Knowledge**. Exposes, reveals, and dispels ignorance and error.

> [John 8:32](https://biblehub.com/john/8-32.htm). the truth will set you free.

**Goodness & Righteousness**. Contrasts with the darkness of sin and evil. It represents moral purity and upright living.

> [1 John 1:5](https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm). God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.

**Guidance & Direction**. Illuminates the path and shows us the way forward.

> [Psalm 119:105](https://biblehub.com/psalm/119-105.htm). Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.

**Hope & Salvation**. Overcomes the darkness of despair and death.

> [Isaiah 9:2](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm). The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned.

**Divine Presence & Glory**. Associated with God's presence and holiness.

> [Revelation 21:23](https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm). The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God give it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.

## New Testament Words

### LIGHT

φῶς (phos). The primary word for *light* used in this passage. 

- It can mean: illumination, understanding, and spiritual truth.

- Think: sun, moon, stars, and lamps. Also: life, truth, purity, and salvation.

### LAMP

λύχνος (lychnos). The word used for *lamp* in in this passage. 

- Refers specifically to a container with a wick that burns oil. 

- Bringing the Gospel light to a more personal setting, shining on all in the house.

### Who does the word LIGHT describe in the Bible?

**God**. The Lord is my *light* and my salvation… ([Psalm 27:1](https://biblehub.com/psalm/27-1.htm))

**Jesus**. I am the *light* of the world… ([John 8:12](https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm))

**Disciples**. You are the *light* of the world… ([Matthew 5:14](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm))

- More accurately, we **REFLECT** the *light* of God & Jesus.

## A Breakdown of the Passage

### Three Parts

Who we are, What not to do, and What to do.

### Who we are

> You are the light of the world.

A declarative statement, not a suggestion. Our identity as Jesus' followers is inherently light-bearing.

The **WORLD** is our *mission field*. It's not just within the church or religious community, but in all aspects of life: work, family, social interactions, etc.

This can be **empowering**, reminding us of our inherent potential, but also **daunting**, highlighting the responsibility to live up to that calling.

### What not to do

> A city on a hill cannot be hidden... Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket...

These are illustrations of the absurdity of hiding light. Light is *meant* to be **SEEN**.

**City on a hill**. A city perched high on a hill is naturally visible from a distance. 

- A true Christian life, lived according to kingdom principles, will inevitably attract attention.

**Lamp under a basket**. Lighting a lamp and then covering it defeats the purpose. A *basket* (Greek: modios) was a dry measuring container for grain. The light cannot fulfill its purpose when hidden. 

- Christians may hide their light because they do not want to be seen, or are afraid of being seen.

**Common Thread**. Both examples highlight the intentionality of hiding. It's not an accident; it's a deliberate act that goes against the very nature of light.

### What to do

> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

Core instruction: actively and intentionally let your light shine.

**Let your light shine before men**. Be visibile, be intentional. It's not about drawing attention to ourselves, but to purposefully display the light of Christ.

**Good deeds**. Actions show the light. Reflect God's love and character. These deeds flow naturally from a life transformed by the gospel.

**Glorify your Father**. Tell. Point to Him. Good deeds are not for self-promotion but to bring honor and praise to God. 

Words without actions won't do it. And neither with actions with out words.

## What doesn't work so well…

### …when trying to let LIGHT shine?

**Isolation**. Creating separate *Christian* communities that limit interaction with non-believers.

**Proclamation**. Relying solely on impersonal methods like evangelism and tracts to share the gospel.

### What should we do instead? 

**Make Contact**. Actively engaging with non-believers in everyday life. Hang out with people who don't know Jesus.

**Build Relationships**. Care about people, serve them.

**Be Available**. Be ready to talk about **WHY** you're doing what you're doing.

**Point to Jesus**. Explicitly giving credit to God for the good works.

### A few final thoughts.

**Being & Letting**. There's a subtle but important distinction between being light and letting your light shine. 

- We are light because of our relationship with Christ, but we must actively choose to let that light shine through our actions and words.

**Community**. It's not just about individual piety; it's about a collective witness. The city on a hill is a community of believers whose combined light illuminates the world.

## Letting our LIGHT shine

### How might we do it?

**Living Out Kingdom Values**. Demonstrating love, compassion, forgiveness, justice, and humility in our daily lives.

**Sharing the Gospel**. Proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ through our words and actions.

**Serving Others**. Meeting the needs of those around us, both physically and spiritually.

**Standing for Truth**. Upholding biblical principles and speaking out against injustice and evil.

**Being Authentic & Transparent**. Living with integrity and honesty, allowing others to see Christ in us.

### What keeps us from doing it?

**Sin & Unrepentance**. Think: hypocrisy, Unconfessed sin dims our light and hinders our ability to reflect Christ.

**Fear of Man**. Worrying about what others think can lead us to compromise our values and hide our light.

**Worldliness**. Becoming too attached to material possessions, worldly pleasures, and societal approval.

**Self-Righteousness**. Think: pride, legalism, judgmental. Focusing on our own perceived goodness rather than acknowledging our need for God's grace.

**Complacency & Apathy**. Losing our passion for God and His mission in the world.

## Closing

### Application

In what areas of your life do you feel you are shining light effectively?

What are some challenges you face in letting your light shine?

How can we encourage and support each other in being light in the world?

What practical steps can you take this week to be a better reflection of Christ's light?

### Challenge

This week, identify one area where you can let your light shine more brightly, whether it's through an act of kindness, a word of truth, or a demonstration of love. Be intentional about pointing others to Christ through your actions and words.

### Pray.
Pray that God would empower the class to be effective witnesses for Him, shining His light into a dark world.
