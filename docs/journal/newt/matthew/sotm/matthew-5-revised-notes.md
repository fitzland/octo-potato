# Matthew 5:21-26 (Berean Standard Bible) - Anger and Reconciliation

## Passage Text
> 21 You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'Do not murder' and 'Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.'
> 
> 22 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be subject to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be subject to the fire of hell.
> 
> 23 So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, 
> 
> 24 leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
> 
> 25 Reconcile quickly with your adversary, while you are still on the way to court. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. 
> 
> 26 Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

## Context

This passage is part of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7), where Jesus reveals the nature of righteousness in the Kingdom of Heaven. It appears in the section on citizens of the Kingdom, specifically addressing their motives (5:17-48).

Jesus has just stated that He did not come to abolish the Law but to fulfill it, and that our righteousness must exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees (5:17-20). This passage is the first of six "antitheses" where Jesus contrasts traditional understanding ("You have heard it said...") with His deeper interpretation ("But I say to you...").

## I. Traditional Understanding of Murder (v. 21)

### The Original Commandment
- From the Decalogue: "Do not murder" (Exodus 20:13, Deuteronomy 5:17)
- The Hebrew term *ratsach* specifically refers to unlawful, intentional killing with malice
- Distinguished from other forms of killing in the OT:
  - Manslaughter (unintentional killing - Numbers 35:9-28)
  - Capital punishment (state-sanctioned execution - Exodus 21:12)
  - Warfare (national defense)
  - Self-defense (Exodus 22:2)

### The Basis for the Prohibition
- Human life is sacred because people are created in God's image (Genesis 1:27)
- "Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed" (Genesis 9:6)
- Consequences for murder included capital punishment and blood guilt that "polluted the land" (Numbers 35:33-34)

## II. Jesus' Deeper Understanding (v. 22)

Jesus doesn't contradict the Law but reveals its deeper, heart-level intent. He shifts focus from the external act to the internal attitude.

### A. Anger as the Root of Murder
- "Anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment"
- Anger receives the same level of culpability as the act of murder
- **Cross-references:**
  - "Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer" (1 John 3:15)
  - Cain's anger preceded his murder of Abel (Genesis 4:5-8)
  - "Be angry, yet do not sin" (Ephesians 4:26-27)
  - "Man's anger does not bring about the righteousness that God desires" (James 1:19-20)

### B. Escalating Contempt and Consequences

Jesus illustrates how internal anger manifests verbally with increasing severity:

| Expression | Meaning | Consequence |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Anger** | Internal hostility | Subject to judgment |
| **"Raca"** | Aramaic term meaning "empty-headed" or "worthless" (contempt for intellect/worth) | Subject to the Sanhedrin (highest Jewish court) |
| **"You fool!"** | Greek *mōros*, implying moral and spiritual deficiency, godlessness (Psalm 14:1) | Subject to the fire of hell (Gehenna) |

- **Cross-references:**
  - "The words of the reckless pierce like swords" (Proverbs 12:18)
  - "Men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word" (Matthew 12:36-37)
  - The destructive power of the tongue (James 3:6-10)

## III. Priority of Reconciliation Over Religious Ritual (vv. 23-24)

### The Radical Command
- "If you are offering your gift at the altar and remember that your brother has something against you..."
- Offering gifts at the altar was a central act of Jewish worship and covenant relationship
- Types of offerings included sacrifices for atonement, fellowship, thanksgiving, and dedication

### What Takes Precedence?
- Traditional focus: ritual purity and correctness of the offering
- Jesus' teaching: relational reconciliation takes absolute priority over religious ritual
- Leave your gift → Go be reconciled → Then return to worship

### Significance
- God values restored human relationships more than religious rituals performed while relationships remain broken
- The horizontal relationship (person-to-person) directly impacts the vertical relationship (person-to-God)
- **Cross-references:**
  - "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Matthew 9:13, Hosea 6:6)
  - "If you hold anything against anyone, forgive him" (Mark 11:25)
  - "If anyone says, 'I love God,' yet hates his brother, he is a liar" (1 John 4:20)

## IV. Urgency of Reconciliation (vv. 25-26)

### The Legal Analogy
- "Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court"
- Failure to reconcile leads to escalating consequences: adversary → judge → officer → prison
- "You will not get out until you have paid the last penny" - implies complete execution of the sentence

### Spiritual Implications
- This has both practical and spiritual applications
- There is urgency in resolving conflicts - both in human relationships and with God
- The time for reconciliation is limited - "while you are still on the way"
- **Cross-references:**
  - A parallel passage emphasizing urgency (Luke 12:57-59)
  - "As far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone" (Romans 12:18)
  - The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (Matthew 18:21-35)

## Key Theological Themes

1. **Internal Righteousness**: God judges the heart, not just external actions
2. **Authority of Jesus**: He claims authority to interpret and deepen the Law
3. **Relationship Priority**: Reconciled relationships precede acceptable worship
4. **Urgency**: Time for dealing with sin and seeking reconciliation is limited

## Application Points

1. Examine your heart for attitudes of anger, resentment, or contempt toward others
2. Take the initiative to seek reconciliation, even when you believe you're not at fault
3. Prioritize healthy relationships over religious activities or rituals
4. Address conflicts quickly and directly before they escalate
5. Recognize that your words reveal the condition of your heart
6. Remember that your relationship with God is connected to your relationships with others

## Reflection Questions

1. In what areas of your life might you be focusing on external obedience while neglecting heart attitudes?
2. Is there anyone with whom you need to seek reconciliation before continuing in worship?
3. How do you typically respond when someone offends you? Do you harbor anger or seek reconciliation?
4. How might your speech reveal contempt for others? What words do you use that devalue people made in God's image?
5. What practical steps can you take today to reconcile a broken relationship?
6. What is the difference between righteous indignation and sinful anger? How can you discern between them?
7. How does Jesus' teaching here challenge cultural attitudes about conflict resolution?
8. In what ways might church practices today inadvertently prioritize ritual over reconciliation?
