# **Righteousness: Murder (Matthew 5:21-26)**

> **21** “You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not murder,’ and ‘Whoever murders will be subject to judgment.’
> **22** But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca,’ will be subject to the Sanhedrin. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to the fire of hell.
> **23** So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
> **24** leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
> **25** Reconcile quickly with your adversary, while you are still on the way to court. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.
> **26** Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.”

**Context:** This passage is part of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus is teaching His disciples (and the listening crowds) about the nature of righteousness in the Kingdom of Heaven. He contrasts the common understanding and application of the Mosaic Law with its deeper, internal, and more demanding spiritual intent. This specific section addresses the sixth commandment.

## **Murder Begins in the Heart (vv. 21-22)**

*   **A. Traditional Understanding Recalled (v. 21):**
    *   Jesus starts by stating the known commandment: "Do not murder" (Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17).
    *   He also notes the understood consequence: murderers face judgment (likely referring to human courts, as specified in passages like Exodus 21:12, Numbers 35:16-31).
    *   *Detail:* This focused on the external act of taking a life.

    Okay, let's explore the concept of "murder" within the context of the Old Testament Law, which provides the backdrop for Jesus' teaching in Matthew 5. Understanding this helps clarify *what* Jesus was intensifying.

The primary Hebrew word translated as "murder" in the commandment "You shall not murder" (Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17 - BSB) is **רָצַח** (*ratsach*). Understanding its specific meaning is crucial.

**Key Aspects of *Ratsach* (Murder) in the Old Testament:**

1.  **Specific Kind of Killing:** *Ratsach* does **not** refer to all killing of human beings. It specifically denotes the **unlawful, intentional, and often premeditated killing** of another human being. It's killing driven by malice, hatred, vengeance, or personal gain outside the boundaries of legally sanctioned actions.

2.  **Distinction from Other Killings:** The Old Testament Law carefully distinguished *ratsach* from other forms of taking human life:
    *   **Accidental Killing (Manslaughter):** Killing someone unintentionally, without prior hatred or planning, was treated differently. The Law provided **Cities of Refuge** (Numbers 35:9-28; Deuteronomy 19:1-13; Joshua 20) where someone who killed accidentally (*bishgagah* - by mistake, unintentionally) could flee. They were protected from the "avenger of blood" (a kinsman seeking retribution) until their case was judged. If found truly accidental, they had to remain in the city of refuge until the death of the current High Priest. This system highlights that *intent* was a critical factor. A deliberate murderer (*ratsach*) found no protection in these cities.
    *   **Judicial Execution (Capital Punishment):** The Law itself *prescribed* the death penalty for certain serious offenses, including premeditated murder (*ratsach*), kidnapping, adultery, blasphemy, etc. (e.g., Exodus 21:12, 16; Leviticus 20:10; Leviticus 24:16). These state-sanctioned executions, carried out after due process (requiring witnesses, judgment), were not considered *ratsach*. They were seen as the just administration of God's Law.
    *   **Killing in Warfare:** Wars commanded or permitted by God (like the conquest of Canaan or defensive wars) involved killing but were generally understood within a different framework than personal, unlawful murder (*ratsach*). This was corporate action under perceived divine mandate or national defense, not individual malicious killing.
    *   **Self-Defense:** While less detailed, the Law implicitly recognized the right to self-defense. For example, killing a thief breaking into one's house at night was permissible (Exodus 22:2).

3.  **Sanctity of Human Life (Image of God):** The prohibition against *ratsach* is deeply rooted in the belief that humans are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). Unlawfully taking a human life was therefore an assault not just on the individual but on the God in whose image they were made.
    *   **Genesis 9:6 (BSB):** "Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made mankind." This verse, given after the Flood long before the Mosaic Law, establishes the principle: taking a life made in God's image demands the forfeiture of the killer's life as a just consequence.

4.  **Consequences of *Ratsach*:**
    *   **Capital Punishment:** The penalty for proven *ratsach* was death. There was no possibility of substitution or paying a ransom (Numbers 35:31). The principle of *lex talionis* ("life for life" - Exodus 21:23-24) applied directly here.
    *   **Bloodguilt and Land Pollution:** Unavenged murder was believed to pollute the land where the community lived (Numbers 35:33-34). The land could only be cleansed by the blood (execution) of the one who shed innocent blood. This highlights the corporate and spiritual dimensions of the crime. Justice was required not just for the victim's family but for the purity and well-being of the whole community before God.
    *   **Avenger of Blood (*Go'el Haddam*):** A designated kinsman had the right and duty to execute the convicted murderer (Numbers 35:19). This was a legal mechanism, not uncontrolled vigilantism, functioning after guilt was established.

**Summary in Context of Matthew 5:**

When Jesus quoted, "You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not murder (*ratsach*),’" his audience understood this commandment primarily in terms of the **physical act of unlawful, intentional killing** with its severe legal consequences (judgment, likely referring to human courts and ultimately the death penalty). They focused on avoiding the *external act*.

Jesus then expanded this, showing that the spirit of the commandment goes much deeper. The same **root of malice and disregard for the value of another human being** (made in God's image) that leads to physical murder (*ratsach*) is present in **unrighteous anger, contemptuous speech ("Raca"), and condemning judgment ("You fool!")**. While the Old Testament Law primarily dealt with the external act, Jesus revealed that God judges the internal attitude with equal seriousness, connecting these heart issues to judgment, even the "fire of hell." He wasn't lessening the gravity of physical murder; He was elevating the gravity of the internal sins that are its seed.

*   **B. Jesus' Authoritative Correction ("But I tell you...") (v. 22):**
    *   Jesus claims authority equal to or greater than the traditional interpretation of the Law.
    *   He shifts the focus from the *outward act* of murder to the *internal attitude* that precedes it.

*   **C. Anger as the Root of Murder (v. 22a):**
    *   *Detail:* Being angry with a brother (fellow human, especially fellow believer) *without cause* or with simmering resentment makes one "subject to judgment." This is the same level of culpability initially mentioned for actual murder, indicating God sees the sinful root in the heart.
    *   *Cross-references:*
        *   **1 John 3:15 (BSB):** "Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him." (Direct parallel connecting hatred/anger and murder).
        *   **Genesis 4:5-8:** Cain's anger preceded his murder of Abel.
        *   **Ephesians 4:26-27 (BSB):** "Be angry, yet do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the devil a foothold." (Acknowledges anger can occur, but warns against letting it fester into sin).
        *   **James 1:19-20 (BSB):** "...Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger, for man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness that God desires."

*   **D. Escalating Contempt and Condemnation (v. 22b-c):**
    *   Jesus illustrates how internal anger manifests verbally with increasing severity and corresponding judgment:
        *   **"Raca":** An Aramaic term of contempt, meaning "empty-headed," "worthless." Saying this makes one subject to the "Sanhedrin" (the highest Jewish court), implying a very serious offense in God's eyes, more severe than simple anger.
        *   **"You fool!" (Greek: *Mōre*):** This term implies moral and spiritual deficiency, perhaps even godlessness or utter condemnation of the person's character. Jesus states this makes one liable to the "fire of hell" (Gehenna), the place of final judgment.
    *   *Detail:* This progression shows that words stemming from anger and contempt are not trivial; they reflect a murderous spirit and carry eternal weight.
    *   *Cross-references:*
        *   **James 3:6-10:** The destructive power of the tongue.
        *   **Proverbs 12:18 (BSB):** "The words of the reckless pierce like swords, but the tongue of the wise brings healing."
        *   **Matthew 12:36-37 (BSB):** "But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.”
    Okay, let's break down the comparison between saying "Raca" and "You fool!" in Matthew 5:22 (BSB) and the significance of their respective consequences.

**The Context Recap:**

Jesus is elevating the understanding of the Sixth Commandment ("Do not murder"). He argues that the sin doesn't just lie in the physical act but originates in the heart—specifically, in anger and contempt towards another person. He then provides a scale of escalating severity:

1.  **Internal Anger:** "Anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment."
2.  **Contemptuous Speech (Raca):** "Anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca,’ will be subject to the Sanhedrin."
3.  **Condemnatory Speech (Fool):** "And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to the fire of hell."

**Analyzing the Terms and Consequences:**

**1. "Raca"**

*   **Meaning:** This is an Aramaic term of abuse and contempt. It literally means "empty one" or "empty-headed." It's akin to calling someone brainless, stupid, worthless, or insignificant.
*   **Nature of the Insult:** It's an expression of profound *contempt* and *dismissal*. It attacks the person's intelligence and inherent worth, essentially saying, "You are nothing; your opinion/existence doesn't matter." It dehumanizes the person by reducing them to emptiness.
*   **Consequence:** "Subject to the Sanhedrin."
    *   The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish judicial council in Jerusalem, composed of 71 members (elders, chief priests, scribes). It dealt with the most serious religious and legal matters.
    *   **Significance:** Jesus isn't necessarily saying that the historical Sanhedrin would literally prosecute someone for using this term. Rather, He's using the highest human court as a *benchmark for the seriousness* of the offense in God's eyes. To express such utter contempt for another person ("Raca") is a violation grave enough to warrant, metaphorically speaking, judgment before the highest authority. It signifies a severe breach of community and relationship, deeply offensive to God who created that person.

**2. "You fool!" (Greek: *Mōre*)**

*   **Meaning:** This Greek word (*mōros*, from which we get "moron") carries a heavier weight than just intellectual deficiency. In the biblical context, "foolishness" often implies *moral and spiritual* deficiency. It suggests wickedness, godlessness, or rebellion against God and His wisdom.
    *   *Cross-reference:* **Psalm 14:1 (BSB):** "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'" Here, foolishness is directly linked to atheism and moral corruption.
    *   *Cross-reference:* **Proverbs** repeatedly contrasts the "wise" (righteous, godly) with the "fool" (wicked, perverse, scorner). (e.g., Proverbs 10:1, 14:9, 17:10).
*   **Nature of the Insult:** This term moves beyond simple contempt for someone's intelligence ("Raca") to a *condemnation of their moral character and spiritual standing*. It's essentially judging them as morally corrupt, wicked, or perhaps even irredeemable in God's eyes. It's an attack on their relationship with God and their fundamental moral being.
*   **Consequence:** "Subject to the fire of hell" (Greek: *eis tēn geennan tou pyros* - "into the Gehenna of fire").
    *   Gehenna refers to the Valley of Hinnom, a place outside Jerusalem historically associated with idolatrous child sacrifice (2 Kings 23:10) and later used as a garbage dump where fires continually burned. It became the primary metaphor in Jesus' teaching for the place of final, eternal judgment and punishment for the wicked.
    *   **Significance:** By assigning this ultimate consequence, Jesus indicates that this kind of condemnatory speech reflects a heart condition so severely opposed to God's love and judgment that it aligns the speaker with those deserving eternal punishment. To contemptuously label someone as a moral and spiritual reprobate ("fool") is to usurp God's role as judge and to express a level of malice and condemnation that originates from a heart condition worthy of hell itself.

**Comparison and Escalation:**

| Feature           | "Raca"                                      | "You fool!" (*Mōre*)                            |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**      | Aramaic                                     | Greek                                           |
| **Focus of Insult** | Intellect, Worth ("Empty-headed")           | Moral & Spiritual Character ("Wicked," "Godless") |
| **Nature**        | Contempt, Dismissal                         | Condemnation, Moral Judgment                    |
| **Consequence**   | Subject to the Sanhedrin (Highest Human Court Analogy) | Subject to the Fire of Hell (Eternal Judgment)  |
| **Severity**      | Very Serious                                | Utmost Severity                                 |

**Key Takeaways:**

1.  **Escalation:** Jesus shows a progression from internal anger to external expressions of contempt ("Raca") and finally to outright condemnation ("You fool!"), with correspondingly escalating seriousness and consequences in God's view.
2.  **Heart Matter:** The specific words are less important than the *heart attitude* they reveal – anger, contempt, hatred, and presumptuous judgment.
3.  **Seriousness of Words:** Our words have immense power and reflect the state of our hearts (Matthew 12:34). Contemptuous and condemnatory speech is not trivial; it's deeply sinful.
4.  **Usurping God's Role:** To call someone "fool" in this biblical sense is to pass a final moral and spiritual judgment, a role that belongs to God alone. Doing so out of anger and contempt is exceptionally dangerous.

In essence, Jesus uses this escalating comparison to shock his audience into realizing that the righteousness required for the Kingdom of Heaven goes far beyond merely avoiding physical murder. It demands a profound respect for others, rooted in controlling anger and eliminating contempt and condemnation from the heart and the tongue.

**2. The Priority of Reconciliation Over Religious Ritual (vv. 23-24)**

Okay, let's delve into the significance of offering a gift at the altar in the first-century Jewish context, which is crucial for understanding Jesus' point in Matthew 5:23-24.

**The Significance and Norms of Offering a Gift at the Altar:**

1.  **Central Act of Worship and Covenant:** The Temple in Jerusalem, and specifically its altar(s), was the designated center of Israel's worship life according to the Mosaic Covenant. Bringing offerings was not optional for a devout Jew; it was a commanded means of relating to God.

2.  **Types of Offerings ("Gifts"):** The "gift" (Greek: *dōron*) could refer to various types of offerings prescribed in the Law (detailed primarily in Leviticus 1-7):
    *   **Sacrifices for Atonement:** Sin Offerings (*Chattat*) and Guilt Offerings (*Asham*) were crucial for dealing with unintentional sins and specific trespasses, restoring the individual's relationship with God and the community after wrongdoing.
    *   **Fellowship and Thanksgiving:** Peace Offerings (*Shelamim*), which included thanksgiving offerings, vow offerings, and freewill offerings, often involved a shared meal, signifying communion and peace with God.
    *   **Dedication and Homage:** Burnt Offerings (*Olah*) signified complete surrender and dedication to God. Grain Offerings (*Minchah*) represented the dedication of one's labor and substance.
    *   **Other Gifts:** Tithes and firstfruits were also sometimes brought to the Temple complex.

3.  **Purpose and Meaning:** These offerings served multiple purposes:
    *   **Obedience:** Fulfilling God's commands in the Law.
    *   **Atonement:** Seeking forgiveness and cleansing from sin.
    *   **Worship:** Expressing reverence, adoration, and homage to God.
    *   **Thanksgiving:** Showing gratitude for blessings received.
    *   **Fellowship:** Maintaining and restoring communion with God and the covenant community.
    *   **Seeking Favor:** Approaching God to petition for needs.

4.  **The Ritual Process (The Norm):** Bringing an offering was a serious and structured event:
    *   The worshiper would bring their offering (an unblemished animal, grain, etc.) into the appropriate Temple court.
    *   They would approach the vicinity of the great Brazen Altar in the Court of the Priests.
    *   Priests officiated the process: inspecting the offering, performing the necessary ritual actions (like laying on of hands by the worshiper for animal sacrifices, slaughtering, manipulating the blood against the altar, burning specific portions on the altar fire).
    *   The act of placing the gift *at* or *before* the altar was a pivotal moment signifying its presentation to God.

5.  **High Importance:** This act of presenting an offering at the altar was considered one of the most sacred duties and privileges. It was the prescribed way to draw near to God, deal with sin, express devotion, and maintain one's standing within the covenant community. It was a tangible expression of faith and repentance.

**What Would Usually Take Precedence Over Offering the Gift?**

*Before* Jesus' specific teaching here, the things that would typically halt or take precedence over the *immediate completion* of presenting an offering at the altar were primarily related to **ritual requirements and readiness**:

1.  **Ritual Purity:** A worshiper had to be in a state of ritual purity to enter the sacred Temple precincts and participate in offerings. If someone realized they had contracted ritual impurity (e.g., contact with a dead body, certain bodily discharges - see Leviticus 11-15, Numbers 19), they would first need to undergo the prescribed purification rituals, which could take time, *before* they could proceed with their offering. Uncleanness barred access.
2.  **Correctness of the Offering:** If the offering itself was found to be blemished or unsuitable according to the specific requirements of the Law for that type of offering, it would be rejected. The worshiper would need to procure a proper offering.
3.  **Following Prescribed Order:** The rituals themselves had a specific order. A worshiper couldn't just rush to the altar; they had to follow the steps mediated by the priesthood.
4.  **Major Unrepented Sin (Prophetic Emphasis):** While the *ritual system* itself focused heavily on correct procedure and purity, the prophets had long emphasized that God rejected sacrifices offered by those who were simultaneously living in gross injustice, idolatry, or rebellion without repentance (Isaiah 1:11-17; Jeremiah 7:21-23; Amos 5:21-24; Micah 6:6-8). They declared that God desired "mercy, not sacrifice," and "justice... rather than burnt offerings." However, in the *daily practice* and understanding of many, the ritual often proceeded unless the person was formally excluded or personally convicted to repent first. The *systemic* prerequisite was usually ritual purity, not necessarily proven relational integrity at that exact moment (though relational integrity was certainly part of God's overall expectation for righteousness).

**Jesus' Radical Reordering of Priorities:**

Jesus introduces a revolutionary precedence: **Relational Reconciliation.**

*   He posits a scenario where the worshiper is *already* at the altar, physically present, ritually ready (presumably), gift in hand – the climax of the process.
*   At *that precise moment*, remembering unresolved conflict ("your brother has something against you" – meaning *you* are potentially the offender) becomes the *absolute priority*.
*   The command is stark: **"Leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift."**

**The Significance of Jesus' Teaching:**

Jesus declares that God values restored human relationships so highly that unresolved conflict makes even the most sacred act of worship unacceptable to Him. The horizontal relationship (person-to-person) directly impacts the validity of the vertical relationship (person-to-God) in the context of worship. Internal righteousness, manifesting in reconciled relationships, takes precedence over external religious ritual, no matter how sacred that ritual is considered. God wants the heart and the life aligned *before* He accepts the offering.

*   **A. The Scenario: Worship Interrupted (v. 23):**
    *   Jesus presents a scenario where a person is actively engaged in worship – bringing a gift (sacrifice/offering) to the altar in the Temple.
    *   *Detail:* This was a central act of Jewish religious life, signifying devotion and seeking fellowship with God.
    *   Suddenly, the worshiper remembers that "your brother has something against you." Note the focus: not necessarily that *you* feel wronged, but that *someone else* feels wronged by *you*.

*   **B. The Command: Reconcile First (v. 24):**
    *   The instruction is radical: *Stop* the act of worship. Leave the gift right there.
    *   Go and be reconciled with the offended brother.
    *   *Then*, and only then, return to complete the act of worship.
    *   *Detail:* This demonstrates that God places a higher priority on restored human relationships (horizontal) than on religious rituals performed while relationships are broken. Acceptable worship flows from a right heart, which includes right relationships.
    *   *Cross-references:*
        *   **Mark 11:25 (BSB):** "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your trespasses." (Connects prayer/forgiveness).
        *   **1 John 4:20 (BSB):** "If anyone says, “I love God,” yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen." (Love for God inseparable from love for others).
        *   **Matthew 9:13 / 12:7 (quoting Hosea 6:6):** "But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’" (God values compassion and right relationships over mere ceremony).
        *   **1 Corinthians 11:27-29:** Warnings about partaking in the Lord's Supper unworthily, often interpreted to include unresolved relational conflict.

**3. The Urgency of Reconciliation in Everyday Life (vv. 25-26)**

*   **A. The Analogy: Settling Out of Court (v. 25):**
    *   Jesus uses a practical, everyday illustration: someone being taken to court by an adversary (accuser).
    *   The advice is pragmatic: "Reconcile quickly... while you are still on the way." Settle the matter before it escalates to formal judgment.
    *   *Detail:* Failure to reconcile leads to a progression of negative consequences: judge -> officer -> prison.

*   **B. The Consequence: Full Payment Required (v. 26):**
    *   The imprisonment described is not lenient; one stays "until you have paid the last penny." This implies a strict and complete execution of the sentence or debt.
    *   *Detail:* While this has a literal application to legal and financial disputes, within the context of the Sermon on the Mount, it strongly implies a spiritual parallel. Unresolved sin and conflict (stemming from the anger mentioned earlier) have severe consequences before God, the ultimate Judge. Failing to seek reconciliation carries a heavy spiritual cost.
    *   *Cross-references:*
        *   **Luke 12:57-59:** A very close parallel passage, emphasizing the same urgency.
        *   **Proverbs 25:8 (BSB):** "Do not bring hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame?" (Advises settling disputes).
        *   **Romans 12:18 (BSB):** "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone." (The goal of peaceful relationships).
        *   **Matthew 18:21-35:** The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, showing the severe consequences of failing to extend mercy/forgiveness after receiving it from God.

**Summary of Key Themes:**

1.  **Internal Righteousness:** True righteousness goes beyond external actions (not murdering) to address the internal source of sin (anger, contempt). God judges the heart.
2.  **Seriousness of Anger and Contempt:** Unresolved anger and contemptuous words are spiritually equivalent to murder in God's eyes and have severe consequences.
3.  **Priority of Reconciliation:** Restored relationships with others are essential for acceptable worship and fellowship with God. Relational health takes precedence over ritual.
4.  **Urgency of Reconciliation:** Conflicts should be addressed quickly and proactively to avoid escalating consequences, both temporal and potentially eternal.

This passage calls believers to a higher standard of relational integrity, rooted in controlling the heart's attitudes and prioritizing reconciliation as an essential element of their walk with God.
