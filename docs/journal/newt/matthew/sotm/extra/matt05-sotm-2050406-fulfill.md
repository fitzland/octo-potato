# What are some ways that Jesus fulfilled the Law and the Prophets?

Fulfillment happened in several ways: through direct prophecy, through typology (patterns or types in the OT people/events/institutions foreshadowed Him), by embodying the Law's perfect standard, and by bringing the ceremonial aspects to their ultimate goal.

## **I. Fulfilling Specific Prophecies:**

1.  **Birthplace:**
    *   **OT Prophecy:** Micah 5:2 (BSB) "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come forth for Me One to be ruler over Israel— One whose origins are of old, from the days of eternity."
    *   **NT Fulfillment:** Matthew 2:1-6; Luke 2:4-7 - Jesus was born in Bethlehem, fulfilling this specific geographical prophecy.

2.  **Born of a Virgin:**
    *   **OT Prophecy:** Isaiah 7:14 (BSB) "Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call Him Immanuel."
    *   **NT Fulfillment:** Matthew 1:18-25; Luke 1:26-35 - The Gospels explicitly record the virgin conception and birth of Jesus, linking it to this sign.

3.  **Triumphal Entry:**
    *   **OT Prophecy:** Zechariah 9:9 (BSB) "Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O Daughter of Jerusalem! See, your King comes to you, righteous and victorious, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
    *   **NT Fulfillment:** Matthew 21:1-11; John 12:12-16 - Jesus deliberately orchestrates His entry into Jerusalem riding on a donkey's colt, and the Gospel writers explicitly cite Zechariah.

4.  **Suffering and Death Details (The Suffering Servant):**
    *   **OT Prophecy:** Isaiah 53 (The whole chapter is profound)
        *   v. 3 "He was despised and rejected by men..."
        *   v. 5 "But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed."
        *   v. 7 "He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He did not open His mouth; He was led like a lamb to the slaughter..."
        *   v. 9 "He was assigned a grave with the wicked, yet was with the rich in His death..."
        *   v. 12 "...because He poured out His life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. Yet He bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors."
    *   **NT Fulfillment:** The entire Passion narrative (Matthew 26-27; Mark 14-15; Luke 22-23; John 18-19) details His rejection, suffering, silence before accusers, crucifixion (piercing), burial in Joseph of Arimathea's tomb (rich man), and His role as the sin-bearer. (See Acts 8:30-35 where Philip explains Isaiah 53 refers to Jesus).

5.  **Psalm 22 (Details of Crucifixion):**
    *   **OT Prophecy:** Psalm 22:1 "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?"; v. 7-8 (mockery); v. 16 "they have pierced my hands and my feet"; v. 18 "They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing."
    *   **NT Fulfillment:** Matthew 27:46 (Jesus quotes v.1); Matthew 27:39-43 (mockery); John 19:37, John 20:25-27 (piercing); Matthew 27:35, John 19:23-24 (casting lots for clothes).

## **II. Fulfilling Types and Shadows (Ceremonial Law & Institutions):**

6.  **The Passover Lamb:**
    *   **OT Type:** Exodus 12 - The unblemished lamb whose blood protected Israel from judgment in Egypt.
    *   **NT Fulfillment:** 1 Corinthians 5:7 (BSB) "...For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed." John 1:29 ("Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"). Jesus' death provides atonement and deliverance from God's judgment on sin.

7.  **The Sacrificial System:**
    *   **OT Type:** Leviticus 1-7, 16 - The complex system of animal sacrifices required for atonement and fellowship with God, showing sin required death.
    *   **NT Fulfillment:** Hebrews 9:11-14, 24-28; Hebrews 10:1-18 - Jesus is the *ultimate* and final sacrifice. His one offering perfectly atones for sin, making the repetitive animal sacrifices obsolete. He fulfilled the purpose they pointed towards.

8.  **The High Priesthood:**
    *   **OT Type:** Leviticus; Numbers - The Aaronic priesthood mediated between God and man, offering sacrifices.
    *   **NT Fulfillment:** Hebrews 4:14-16; Hebrews 7-9 - Jesus is the perfect, eternal High Priest after the order of Melchizedek. He doesn't need to offer sacrifices for Himself and offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice once for all. He provides direct access to God.

9.  **The Tabernacle/Temple:**
    *   **OT Type:** Exodus 25-40; 1 Kings 6-8 - The place where God's presence dwelt among His people.
    *   **NT Fulfillment:** John 1:14 (BSB) "The Word became flesh and *dwelt* [Greek: *eskēnōsen*, 'tabernacled'] among us..."; John 2:19-21 (Jesus refers to His body as the temple); 1 Corinthians 6:19 (Believers are the temple of the Holy Spirit); Hebrews 9:11 (Christ entered the "greater and more perfect tabernacle"). Jesus *is* the place where God meets humanity; His presence now dwells in His people.

## **III. Fulfilling the Moral Law:**

10. **Perfect Obedience:**
    *   **OT Demand:** The Law demanded perfect obedience (Deuteronomy 27:26; Galatians 3:10).
    *   **NT Fulfillment:** Hebrews 4:15 ("...yet was without sin."); 1 Peter 2:22 ("He committed no sin..."); Matthew 3:15 (At His baptism: "to fulfill all righteousness."). Jesus lived the perfectly righteous life that the Law required, which no one else could. This perfect righteousness is then imputed to believers (as we discussed).

11. **Embodying the Law's Intent (Love):**
    *   **OT Command:** Deuteronomy 6:5 ("Love the LORD your God with all your heart..."); Leviticus 19:18 ("...love your neighbor as yourself.").
    *   **NT Fulfillment:** Matthew 22:37-40 - Jesus identifies these as the greatest commandments on which "hang all the Law and the Prophets." His entire life and teaching exemplified this perfect love for God and others, revealing the heart behind the commands. He fulfilled the Law by living out its deepest principle.
