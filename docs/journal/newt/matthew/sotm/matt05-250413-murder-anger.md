## Review 

Jesus did not come to **ABOLISH** the Law, but rather to **FULFILL** the Law.

!!! question "Icebreaker"   
    
    What's the difference between being angry and expressing anger? Is one more acceptable than the other?
    
    When you were really angry with someone but managed to hold back from saying or doing something hurtful. What helped you control your anger in that moment, and how did you feel afterward?

## Passage

!!! quote "Matthew 5:21-26"

    21 You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'Do not murder' and 'Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' 
    
    22 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be subject to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be subject to the fire of hell.
    
    23 So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24 leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
    
    25 Reconcile quickly with your adversary, while you are still on the way to court. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

## Context

Jesus has just stated that He did not come to abolish the Law but to fulfill it, and that our righteousness must exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees (5:17-20). This passage is the first of **six antitheses** where Jesus contrasts traditional understanding ("*You have heard it said...*") with His deeper interpretation ("*But I say to you...*").

## The Sixth Commandment

> [`Matthew 5:21`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-21.htm). You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'Do not murder' and 'Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.'

### What is the traditional understanding?

**Decalogue**. We typically hear the sixth commandment as: *Thou shall not kill*, but the Hebrew term specifically refers to unlawful, intentional killing with malice.

!!! info "Murder"   
    (Heb. ratsach). murder, slay, with premeditation.


> [`Exodus 20:13`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-13.htm). Do not murder. Also [`Deuteronomy 5:17`](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-17.htm).

### What are other forms of killing?

**Manslaughter**. Killing someone *unintentionally*, without prior hatred or planning. Intent is a critical factor when determining if the killing is considered murder.

> [`Numbers 35:12`](https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm). You are to have cities as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer will not die until he stands trial before the assembly.

**Capital punishment**. The Law prescribed the *death penalty* for certain offenses, including premeditated murder, kidnapping, adultery, and blasphemy. These state-sanctioned executions, carried out after due process (requiring witnesses, judgment) were not considered murder.

> [`Exodus 21:12`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm). Whoever strikes and kills a man must surely be put to death.

> [`Exodus 21:16`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-16.htm). Whoever kidnaps another man must be put to death, whether he sells him or the man is found in his possession. 

**Warfare**. Wars commanded or permitted by God (*national defense*) involved killing but were generally understood within a different framework than personal, unlawful murder.

> [`Deuteronomy 7:1-2`](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7.htm). When the Lord your God brings you into the land…, then you must destroy them totally. (conquest of Canaan)

> [`1 Samuel 15:1-3`](https://biblehub.com/1samuel/15.htm). Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. (during monarchy)

**Self-defense**. Killing a *thief* breaking into one's house at night. 

> [`Exodus 22:2`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-2.htm). If a thief is caught breaking in and is beaten to death, no one shall be guilty of bloodshed.

### What is the basis for the prohibition?

**Sanctity of Human Life**. Human life is sacred because people are created in the _image of God_ (Genesis 1:27).

- Taking a human life is not just an assault on the individual but on God in whose image they are made.

> [`Genesis 9:6`](https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm). Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed.

- This verse, given after the Flood long before the Mosaic Law, establishes the principle: taking a life made in God's image demands the forfeiture of the killer's life as a just consequence.

### What are the consequences of murder?

**Capital Punishment**. The penalty for proven murder was death. There was no possibility of substitution or paying a ransom (Numbers 35:31). The principle of *lex talionis* ("life for life" - Exodus 21:23-24) applied directly here.

**Bloodguilt**. Unavenged murder was believed to pollute the land where the community lived (Numbers 35:33-34). The land could only be cleansed by the blood (execution) of the one who shed innocent blood.

## A New Interpretation

> [`Matthew 5:22`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm). But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be subject to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be subject to the fire of hell.

### But I tell you...
    
Jesus claims authority equal to or greater than the traditional interpretation of the Law. He shifts the focus from the *outward act* of murder to the *internal attitude* that precedes it.

### What is the root of murder?

The same root of *malice* and *disregard* for the value of another human being that leads to physical murder is present in *unrighteous anger*, *contemptuous speech* (Raca), and *condemning judgment* (You fool!). 

While the Old Testament Law primarily dealt with the *external* act, Jesus revealed that God judges the *internal* attitude with equal seriousness, connecting these heart issues to judgment, even the *fire of hell*. He wasn't lessening the gravity of physical murder; He was elevating the gravity of the internal sins that are its root.

Being angry with a brother *without cause* or with simmering resentment makes one subject to judgment.

> [`1 John 3:15`](https://biblehub.com/1john/3-15.htm). Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer.

> [`Genesis 4:5-8`](https://biblehub.com/genesis/4.htm). Cain's anger preceded his murder of Abel.

> [`Ephesians 4:26-27`](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4.htm). Be angry, yet do not sin.

> [`James 1:19-20`](https://biblehub.com/james/1.htm). Man's anger does not bring about the righteousness that God desires.

### How does anger escalate?

Jesus describes how internal anger manifests verbally with increasing severity:

| Expression | Meaning | Consequence |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Anger** | Internal hostility | Subject to judgment |
| **Raca** | Showing contempt for intellect/worth | Subject to the Sanhedrin (highest Jewish court) |
| **You fool!** | Implying moral and spiritual deficiency (Psalm 14:1) | Subject to the fire of hell (Gehenna) |

!!! info "Raca"   
    (Grk. rhaka). from an Aramaic term meaning empty-headed, worthless.
    
    An expression of profound *contempt* and *dismissal*. It attacks a person's intelligence and inherent worth, essentially saying, "You are nothing; your opinion/existence doesn't matter.

!!! info "Sanhedrin"   
    The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish judicial council in Jerusalem, composed of 71 members (elders, chief priests, scribes). It dealt with the most serious religious and legal matters.

Jesus isn't necessarily saying that the historical Sanhedrin would literally prosecute someone for using this term. Rather, He's using the highest human court as a *benchmark for the seriousness* of the offense in God's eyes.

He is saying that expressing such contempt for another person is a violation bad enough to warrant judgment before the highest authority. It signifies a severe breach of community and relationship, deeply offensive to the God who created that person.

!!! info "You Fool!"   
    (Gr. mōros). dull, stupid; to imply moral and spiritual deficiency, godlessness. 
    
    This word from which we get the word _moron_ carries a heavier weight than just intellectual deficiency. It implies *moral and spiritual* deficiency. 

> [`Psalm 14:1`](https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm). The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'

**Fire of Hell**. By assigning this ultimate consequence, Jesus indicates that this kind of condemnatory speech reflects a heart condition that is so severely opposed to God's love and judgment that it aligns the speaker with those deserving eternal punishment. 

When we label someone as a moral and spiritual reprobate, we usurp God's role as judge and express a level of malice and condemnation that originates from a heart condition worthy of hell itself.

## At the Altar

> [`Matthew 5:23-24`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5.htm#21) So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.

### What is the significance of offering a gift at the altar?

**Act of Worship**. The Temple in Jerusalem, and specifically its altar(s), was the designated center of Israel's worship life according to the Mosaic Covenant. Bringing offerings was not optional for a devout Jew; it was a commanded means of relating to God.

#### Types of Offerings

The _gift_ (Greek: *dōron*) could refer to various types of offerings (Leviticus 1-7):

**Sacrifices for Atonement**. Sin Offerings (*chattat*) and Guilt Offerings (*asham*) were crucial for dealing with unintentional sins and specific trespasses, restoring the individual's relationship with God and the community after wrongdoing.

**Fellowship & Thanksgiving**. Peace Offerings (*shelamim*), which included thanksgiving offerings, vow offerings, and freewill offerings, often involved a shared meal, signifying communion and peace with God.

**Dedication & Homage**. Burnt Offerings (*olah*) signified complete surrender and dedication to God. Grain Offerings (*minchah*) represented the dedication of one's labor and substance.

**Other Gifts**. Tithes and firstfruits were also sometimes brought to the Temple complex.

#### Purpose & Meaning

Offerings served multiple purposes:

**Obedience**. Fulfilling God's commands in the Law.

**Atonement**. Seeking forgiveness and cleansing from sin.

**Worship**. Expressing reverence, adoration, and homage to God.

**Thanksgiving**. Showing gratitude for blessings received.

**Fellowship**. Maintaining and restoring communion with God and the covenant community.

**Seeking Favor**. Approaching God to petition for needs.

#### The Ritual Process

Bringing an offering was a serious and structured event:

**Bringing Offering**. The worshiper would bring their offering (an unblemished animal, grain, etc.) into the appropriate Temple court.

**Approaching Altar**. They would approach the vicinity of the great Brazen Altar in the Court of the Priests.

**Inspection & Ritual**. Priests officiated the process: inspecting the offering, performing the necessary ritual actions (like laying on of hands by the worshiper for animal sacrifices, slaughtering, manipulating the blood against the altar, burning specific portions on the altar fire).

**Presentation**. The act of placing the gift *at* or *before* the altar was a pivotal moment signifying its presentation to God.

**High Importance**. This act of presenting an offering at the altar was considered one of the most sacred duties and privileges. It was the prescribed way to draw near to God, deal with sin, express devotion, and maintain one's standing within the covenant community. It was a tangible expression of faith and repentance.

### What could stop this ritual of worship?

#### Requirements & Readiness

**Ritual Purity**. A worshiper had to be in a state of ritual purity to enter the sacred Temple precincts and participate in offerings. If someone realized they had contracted ritual impurity (e.g., contact with a dead body, certain bodily discharges - see Leviticus 11-15, Numbers 19), they would first need to undergo the prescribed purification rituals, which could take time, *before* they could proceed with their offering. Uncleanness barred access.

**Correctness of the Offering**. If the offering itself was found to be blemished or unsuitable according to the specific requirements of the Law for that type of offering, it would be rejected. The worshiper would need to procure a proper offering.

**Following Prescribed Order**. The rituals themselves had a specific order. A worshiper couldn't just rush to the altar; they had to follow the steps mediated by the priesthood.

**Major Unrepented Sin**. While the *ritual system* itself focused heavily on correct procedure and purity, the prophets had long emphasized that God rejected sacrifices offered by those who were simultaneously living in gross injustice, idolatry, or rebellion without repentance (Isaiah 1:11-17; Jeremiah 7:21-23; Amos 5:21-24; Micah 6:6-8). 

- They declared that God desired "mercy, not sacrifice," and "justice... rather than burnt offerings." However, in the *daily practice* and understanding of many, the ritual often proceeded unless the person was formally excluded or personally convicted to repent first. 

- The *systemic* prerequisite was usually ritual purity, not necessarily proven relational integrity at that exact moment (though relational integrity was certainly part of God's overall expectation for righteousness).

### What new requirement does Jesus offer?

#### Go Be Reconciled

**Reconciliation**. Jesus suggest that relational reconciliation takes absolute priority over religious ritual.

#### Significance

**Relationships**. God values restored human relationships more than religious rituals performed while relationships remain broken.

**Impact**. The horizontal relationship (person-to-person) directly impacts the vertical relationship (person-to-God).

#### Cross-references

> [`Matthew 9:13`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm). I desire mercy, not sacrifice. Also [`Hosea 6:6`](https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm)

> [`Mark 11:25`](https://biblehub.com/mark/11-25.htm) If you hold anything against anyone, forgive him.

> [`1 John 4:20`](https://biblehub.com/1john/4-20.htm) If anyone says, 'I love God,' yet hates his brother, he is a liar.

## IV. Urgency of Reconciliation (vv. 25-26)

### The Legal Analogy
- "Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court"
- Failure to reconcile leads to escalating consequences: adversary → judge → officer → prison
- "You will not get out until you have paid the last penny" - implies complete execution of the sentence

### Spiritual Implications
- This has both practical and spiritual applications
- There is urgency in resolving conflicts - both in human relationships and with God
- The time for reconciliation is limited - "while you are still on the way"
- **Cross-references:**
  - A parallel passage emphasizing urgency (Luke 12:57-59)
  - "As far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone" (Romans 12:18)
  - The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (Matthew 18:21-35)

## Key Theological Themes

1. **Internal Righteousness**: God judges the heart, not just external actions
2. **Authority of Jesus**: He claims authority to interpret and deepen the Law
3. **Relationship Priority**: Reconciled relationships precede acceptable worship
4. **Urgency**: Time for dealing with sin and seeking reconciliation is limited

## Application Points

1. Examine your heart for attitudes of anger, resentment, or contempt toward others
2. Take the initiative to seek reconciliation, even when you believe you're not at fault
3. Prioritize healthy relationships over religious activities or rituals
4. Address conflicts quickly and directly before they escalate
5. Recognize that your words reveal the condition of your heart
6. Remember that your relationship with God is connected to your relationships with others

## Reflection Questions

1. In what areas of your life might you be focusing on external obedience while neglecting heart attitudes?
2. Is there anyone with whom you need to seek reconciliation before continuing in worship?
3. How do you typically respond when someone offends you? Do you harbor anger or seek reconciliation?
4. How might your speech reveal contempt for others? What words do you use that devalue people made in God's image?
5. What practical steps can you take today to reconcile a broken relationship?
6. What is the difference between righteous indignation and sinful anger? How can you discern between them?
7. How does Jesus' teaching here challenge cultural attitudes about conflict resolution?
8. In what ways might church practices today inadvertently prioritize ritual over reconciliation?
