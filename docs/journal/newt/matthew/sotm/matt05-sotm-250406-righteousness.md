# Christ & the Scriptures (Matthew 5:17-20)


## Objective

Learners will understand Jesus' relationship to the Old Testament Law (fulfillment, not abolition), recognize the high standard of God's righteousness, and grasp the necessity of Christ's work and imputed righteousness for entering the Kingdom, leading to genuine, heart-level obedience.

## How Good is Good Enough? (Approx. 5-7 minutes)

Imagine asking someone, 'If you died tonight and God asked why He should let you into heaven, what would you say?' What's a common answer?

Many of us, even as believers saved by grace, might subconsciously feel something similar. But this raises a crucial question Jesus' audience also wrestled with: Just how good is good enough for God? What's the standard?

- Jesus is speaking early in His ministry (Sermon on the Mount) to His disciples and the crowds. They lived in a culture saturated by the Law of Moses (the Torah). There were already debates about how to interpret and apply it.

Introduce Passage. "In Matthew 5:17-20, Jesus directly addresses His relationship to the Old Testament Law and sets the stage for understanding true righteousness required for His Kingdom."

## Passage

 !!! quote "Matthew 5:17-20"

    17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. 18 For I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19 So then, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do likewise will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.   


## Jesus and the Law (Approx. 20-25 minutes)

### Fulfill, Not Abolish

> **Matthew 5:17**. Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.

**Point**. Jesus immediately corrects a potential misunderstanding. Seeing His radical grace and focus on the heart (like the Beatitudes just before this), some might think He's *discarding* [Why?](./extra/matt05-sotm-2050406-abolish.md) the Old Testament ("the Law or the Prophets" - a common way to refer to the entire OT).

#### Key Words:

**Abolish**. (Greek: katalysai): Means *to tear down*, *destroy*, *annul*, *invalidate*. Jesus states He did not come for this purpose.

**Fulfill**. (Greek: plērōsai): Means *to fill up*, *complete*, *bring to its intended goal*, *fully preach/embody*, *bring to realization*.

**Illustration**. (Masterpiece/Building) Jesus isn't tearing down the structure God built in the OT. He is the Master Builder completing the project, bringing it to its glorious, intended conclusion. The OT laid the foundation and framework; Jesus is the *fulfillment* [How?](./extra/matt05-sotm-250406-fulfill.md) and capstone.

**Core Message**. Jesus came to be the living embodiment of the Law's demands, to perfectly obey it, and to bring its foreshadowings and promises to their ultimate reality in Himself.

#### Cross Reference:

> **Romans 10:4**. For Christ is the culmination [Greek: telos - end, goal, completion] of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.

### Law's Enduring Authority and Certainty

> **Matthew 5:18**. For I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 

**Point**. Jesus affirms the absolute divine authority and permanence of the OT Scriptures. Nothing will be arbitrarily discarded.

#### Key Words:

**single jot**. (Greek: iōta): Refers to the Hebrew letter Yod (י), the smallest letter in the alphabet.

**Stroke of a pen**. (Greek: keraia): Refers to the tiny hooks or flourishes that distinguish similar Hebrew letters (like ר vs. ד).

**Illustration**. It's like saying, "Not even the dot on an 'i' or the cross on a 't' will pass away." Jesus uses hyperbole to stress the meticulous divine inspiration and authority of all Scripture.

**Crucial Qualifier**. "...until everything is accomplished." This is key! How is it accomplished? In Christ! His life, death, and resurrection are the accomplishment the Law pointed towards. Things don't disappear by being abolished, but by reaching their intended fulfillment in Him. [How?](./extra/matt05-sotm-2050406-fulfill.md)

#### Cross Reference:

> **Luke 24:44**. Then He told them, 'These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.'" (Jesus Himself claims to be the fulfillment). Hebrews 9-10 (Explains how Christ's sacrifice fulfilled the entire sacrificial system).

### Practicing and Teaching - Reflecting Kingdom Values

> **Matthew 5:19**. 19 So then, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do likewise will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

**Point**. How we regard and handle God's commands (as fulfilled in Christ) matters and reflects our standing within the Kingdom community.

#### Key Words: 

**Breaks/Sets Aside/Relaxes**. (Greek: lysē): This word is related to "abolish" (katalysai) in v.17. It implies loosening the Law's requirements or teaching others that they are no longer binding without understanding their fulfillment in Christ.

**Least vs. Great**. This likely refers to influence and honor within the kingdom community, not salvation itself. Those who rightly understand the Law through Christ, practice it from the heart, and teach it accurately will be esteemed. Those who diminish its significance (even if saved by grace) have a flawed understanding and impact.

**Contrast with Pharisees**. Jesus implicitly critiques the Pharisees here, who often added to the Law while sometimes neglecting its core intent (Matthew 23:23 - tithing mint/dill/cumin but neglecting justice, mercy, faithfulness). They also "relaxed" commands through loopholes (e.g., Mark 7:9-13 - Corban rule).

#### Application: 

We must handle God's Word carefully, seeking its true meaning as revealed and fulfilled in Jesus, and live it out authentically.

### The Shocking Standard - Surpassing the "Experts"

> **Matthew 5:20**. For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 

**Point**. Jesus drops a bombshell: Entrance into the kingdom requires a righteousness greater [Why?](./extra/matt05-250406-surpass.md) than that of the most meticulous religious experts of the day.

**Context**. The Pharisees and Scribes were seen as the epitome of religious observance. They dedicated their lives to studying and keeping the Law (externally). If their righteousness isn't enough, whose could be?

**Illustration** (High Jump). Imagine the Pharisees setting the high jump bar at what seemed an impressive height (their external rule-keeping). Jesus comes along and says, "That's not nearly high enough. The real standard is perfect holiness, set by God Himself." No human can clear that bar on their own.

**Implication**. This verse is meant to drive listeners (and us) to despair of self-righteousness. If the "best" fall short, we all fall short. Human effort, however sincere or meticulous, cannot meet God's perfect standard.

#### **Cross Reference**. 

> **Romans 3:20**. Therefore no one will be justified in His sight by works of the law. For the law merely brings awareness of sin." Philippians 3:4-9 (Paul lists his impeccable Jewish credentials but counts them as "rubbish" compared to gaining Christ and the righteousness from God through faith).

## The Solution. Achieving Greater Righteousness (Approx. 10-12 minutes)

**The Dilemma**. Verse 20 leaves us with a problem: If even the Pharisees' righteousness isn't enough, how can anyone enter the kingdom? How good is good enough? The answer: Perfection.

**The Divine Provision**. This is where the Gospel shines! The righteousness God requires is the righteousness God provides.

**Point**. We cannot earn this righteousness; it is a gift received through faith in Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the Law for us.

**Key Concept**. Imputed Righteousness. God credits Christ's perfect record to those who believe in Him.

### Cross References:

> **Romans 3:21-22**. But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, as attested by the Law and the Prophets. And this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.

> **2 Corinthians 5:21**. God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.

> **Romans 8:3-4**. For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. (The Law's requirements are met in us because of Christ!)

## Application. Living Out Fulfilled Righteousness (Approx. 10-15 minutes)

So What Now? If righteousness is a gift, what's our response? Does the Law become irrelevant? No! Jesus fulfilled it, He didn't erase its reflection of God's character.

A. Value the Whole Counsel of God. The Old Testament, understood through the lens of Christ's fulfillment, remains vital.

Cross Reference. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 (BSB) "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work." (Paul was primarily referring to the OT here). It reveals God's character, His plan, and principles for godly living.

B. Obey Out of Love, Not Fear or Duty. Our motivation changes.

Point. We don't obey to be saved or to earn God's favor (we already have it in Christ!). We obey because we are saved and loved.

Illustration (Dad's Birthday Gift). Your illustration is powerful here. Obedience isn't drudgery; it's preparing a gift of love for the One who gave us everything. It flows from gratitude and a desire to please Him.

Cross Reference. 1 John 5:3 (BSB) "For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome."

C. Pursue Genuine, Heart-Level Righteousness. Jesus wants more than external conformity.

Point. The "greater righteousness" surpasses the Pharisees because it's internal, not just external. It involves changed motives, desires, and attitudes.

Contrast. The Pharisees cleaned the outside of the cup, but Jesus cleans the inside (Matthew 23:25-26). True righteousness is authenticity, not hypocrisy. It's the Spirit working within us to align our hearts with God's Law, which is now written on our hearts (Jeremiah 31:33, Hebrews 8:10).

Connection. This sets up the rest of Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the deeper intent behind commands like "Do not murder" (includes anger) and "Do not commit adultery" (includes lust).

## Conclusion & Challenge (Approx. 3-5 minutes)

Summarize Key Points. Jesus didn't come to destroy the Law but to be its perfect fulfillment. The standard for God's Kingdom is a righteousness far beyond human achievement. This perfect righteousness is freely given through faith in Jesus Christ.

### Challenge:

Are you relying on your own "goodness," or have you received the "greater righteousness" that comes only through faith in Jesus?

How does understanding Christ's fulfillment of the Law change the way you view the Old Testament?

Is your obedience motivated by love and gratitude, flowing from a changed heart, or is it merely external rule-keeping?

### Closing Prayer

Pray, thanking God for the Law that reveals His holiness, for Jesus who perfectly fulfilled it, for the gift of His righteousness through faith, and asking for the Spirit's help to live genuinely obedient lives out of love for Him.

## Possible Discussion Questions

What did "fulfill" mean to Jesus' original audience? How is it different from "abolish"?

Why is it important that nothing from the Law would disappear until accomplished? What does this tell us about God and His Word?

How does the righteousness Jesus requires (v. 20) differ from what the Pharisees practiced?

If salvation is by grace through faith, why does Jesus emphasize practicing and teaching the commands (v. 19)?

How does the "Dad's Birthday Gift" illustration change your perspective on obedience?
