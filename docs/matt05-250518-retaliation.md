## Righteousness—Retaliation & Redemption

### Introduction

#### Structure/Outline

Manifesto of the King

1.  Citizens of the Kingdom (ch 5)

    1.  Quality (1-12)
    2.  Function (13-16)
    3.  Motive (17-48)

2.  Values of the Kingdom (ch 6)

3.  Relationship with the Kingdom (ch 7)

#### Context

We are studying the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7). Jesus teaches us about life in the Kingdom of Heaven.

As He lays out the ethics and righteousness expected of citizens in the Kingdom of Heaven.

Jesus used the following pattern:

_You have heard it said… But I say to you…_

And, He's raising the standard from **outward conformity** to **inward transformation**.

##### A Review of the Last Few Passages

- Jesus didn’t come to _abolish_ the Law, but rather to **fulfill**.

- Our righteousness must _exceed_ that of the Pharisees.

- Our internal _anger_ can lead to outward **murder**.
 
- Our _lust_ is actually **adultery** of the heart.
 
- Divorce is not _encouraged_, but **allowed** and it’s not just because someone is _displeasing_.
 
- Our speech should be _truthful_, _consistent_ and _reliable_.

##### In this passage

Jesus challenges the common understanding of justice (*an eye for an eye*) and calls His disciples to a radical new way of responding to evil and personal offenses—one that involves non-retaliation and proactive generosity.

**Note**. Jesus is addressing our _personal_, _individual_ response to being wronged. He is not telling us to _enable_ abuse, _ignore_ systemic injustice, or _fail to protect_ the vulnerable.

His teaching prioritizes God's _redemptive purposes_ over **personal rights** or vengeance; responding to evil not with passive acceptance, but with creative, dignity-preserving alternatives that can transform situations and hearts.

!!! question "Icebreaker"

    Think about a time you were treated unfairly or someone wronged you personally. What was your immediate, gut reaction? What did you want to do?

Societal Norms. How does society (or even **our own instincts**) tell us we should respond when our rights are violated or we are attacked?

### What the Law Actually Taught. 

[`Matthew 5:38`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-38.htm). You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’

#### Old Testament Basis. 

This principle, *Lex Talionis *(Latin for law of retaliation), is found in several Old Testament passages.

[`Exodus 21:23-25`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/21.htm#23). But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.

[`Leviticus 24:19-20`](https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24.htm#19). If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him: fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Whatever injury he has inflicted, the same is to be inflicted on him.

[`Deuteronomy 19:21`](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm). Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

#### Original Purpose.

##### Limiting Vengeance. 

Primarily, it was designed to limit and restrict personal revenge and escalating blood feuds. Instead of someone taking a life for an eye, or wiping out a whole family for an injury, the punishment was to be proportional to the crime. It set an upper limit on retribution.

##### Ensuring Public Justice, Not Personal Revenge. 

This law was intended for magistrates and judges in a civil court setting to ensure fair and equitable justice. It was not a mandate for individuals to take personal revenge.

##### Upholding the Value of Each Person. 

By demanding equal retribution, it implicitly stated that all individuals (within the covenant community) had equal value. An eye of a commoner was worth an eye of a noble.

#### Misinterpretation & Misapplication. 

By Jesus' day, this principle was being misunderstood or misapplied by some to justify personal retaliation and a spirit of vengeance, rather than being seen as a guide for civic justice administered by authorities. People might have felt they had a *right* to exact personal revenge on a one-for-one basis.

*Can we see how easily a principle designed for societal justice *can* be twisted to justify personal revenge?*

### A Different Response to Evil.

Matthew 5:39a. But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.

#### Distinct Shift. 

But I tell you… signals Jesus' divine authority and a profound shift in perspective for His followers.

#### Command Explained. 

Do not resist. (Grk. anthistēmi) means to stand against, oppose, resist, or withstand, often in a direct, confrontational, or retaliatory way.

an evil person. refers to someone who is actively doing wrong or causing harm, particularly to the believer.

Note. Jesus is talking about not retaliating against a *person *who does evil to you, not about being passive towards *evil itself *or demonic influence.

#### Initial Impact and Implication. 

This command is shocking and counter-intuitive to our natural human responses. It seems to suggest passivity in the face of wrongdoing.

*How does this command strike you initially?*

Jesus is calling His disciples to voluntarily lay down their right to personal retaliation when wronged.

This isn't about denying that evil exists, but about choosing a radically different way to respond to it.

### Practical Examples of Non-Retaliation.

Jesus provides four concrete examples of what this non-resistance looks like in everyday life.

*Can you think of modern parallels for each one?*

#### Turning the Other Cheek. 

Matthew 5:39b. If anyone slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.

A slap on the right cheek (typically with the back of the right hand if both parties are right-handed) was a profound insult in that culture, more about humiliation and dishonor than causing serious physical injury. It was an act of contempt.

This wasn't just any insult but specifically a backhanded slap, which was how superiors treated inferiors. By turning the other cheek, you weren't inviting further abuse, but standing with dignity and requiring the aggressor to treat you as an equal if they struck again.

*When have you been tempted to let the negativity of someone else drag you down to their level?*

Romans 12:17-21. Do not repay anyone evil for evil... overcome evil with good

1 Peter 2:21-23. Christ's example of not retaliating when insulted.

##### Jesus' Response. 

Instead of retaliating or demanding an apology for this affront to one's dignity, Jesus says to offer the other cheek. This is not an act of cowardice, but a courageous act of breaking the cycle of insult and retaliation. It can disarm the aggressor and challenge their actions.

##### What it does. 

Refusal to let the evil person dictate the terms of the encounter or to be drawn down to their level of animosity. It's about maintaining one's own Christ-like composure and offering a different way.

#### Giving the Tunic (Cloak) 

Matthew 5:40. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.

The *tunic* (Grk. chitōn) was the inner garment, a basic necessity. The *cloak* (Grk. himation) was the outer garment, often used as a blanket at night and more valuable. Under Jewish law (Exodus 22:26-27), a creditor could not permanently keep a poor man's cloak if taken as a pledge, as it was essential for survival.

*How attached are we to our possessions, to the point that we would fight tooth and nail?*

##### Jesus' Response. 

If someone is so determined to exploit you legally that they sue for your basic inner tunic, Jesus says to go beyond what they demand and offer your more valuable outer cloak as well. This is startling, absurd, generosity.

##### What it does. 

Demonstrates a detachment from material possessions and a willingness to suffer loss rather than engage in bitter contention. It again changes the dynamic of the confrontation, highlighting the exploiter's greed by an unexpected act of sacrificial giving.

#### Going the Second Mile. 

Matthew 5:41. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two.

*forces* (Grk. angareuō) refers to the Roman practice of impressment. A Roman soldier could legally compel a civilian in an occupied territory to carry his pack or equipment for one Roman mile (about 1,000 paces). This was a constant reminder of their subjugation.

*Where in your life do you feel forced or obligated?*

Philippians 2:3-4. In humility consider others better than yourselves.

##### Jesus' Response. 

Instead of begrudgingly complying or resisting (leading to punishment), Jesus says to willingly go a second mile.

##### What it does. 

Transforms an act of forced servitude into an act of voluntary, cheerful service. It reclaims agency and dignity, and can baffle the oppressor. It’s a way of overcoming evil with good, demonstrating a spirit that cannot be crushed by oppression.

#### Giving and Loaning Freely.

Matthew 5:42. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

This extends the principle of generosity beyond responses to direct antagonism. It calls for an open-handed, compassionate response to those in need.

*How does our willingness to be generous reflect our trust in God as Provider?*

2 Corinthians 9:6-8. God loves a cheerful giver.

Proverbs 19:17. Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD.

##### Jesus' Response. 

Followers of Christ should be characterized by a willingness to give and lend without an overly calculating or grudging spirit.

##### What it does. 

Reflects the generous heart of God Himself, who gives good gifts to all (Matthew 5:45). It cultivates a spirit of mercy and reliance on God as our ultimate provider, rather than clinging tightly to our own resources.

Note. Presumes that the needs are genuine.

Augustine. give *to *everyone that asks,  
not give *everything *to him that asks.

### Kingdom Principles at Play.

#### Beyond Mere Passivity. 

We are not called to be a spineless doormat or to enable sin. We are called to offer proactive, often startling, responses that break cycles of violence, greed, and oppression.

#### Overcoming Evil with Good. 

Romans 12:21. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. The goal is not just to absorb wrong, but to introduce a transformative element into the situation.

#### Reflecting the Character of God. 

Our ethic should reflect the merciful, patient, and generous character of God the Father, who extends grace even to His enemies (Matthew 5:45).

#### Witness and Potential for Transformation. 

Such unexpected responses can act as a powerful witness, potentially shaming the wrongdoer, making them think, or even opening a door for their heart to be changed.

#### Surrendering Personal Rights. 

We are asked to to surrender what we might consider our personal *rights* (to dignity, property, freedom from imposition, retaliation) for the sake of Kingdom purpose.

#### Breaking Cycles. 

Retaliation breeds more retaliation. Jesus offers a way to stop the destructive cycle.

### Why This Radical Call? The Goal.

#### Reflect the Father. 

As we'll see more clearly in the next section (loving enemies), this behavior is rooted in imitating the character of our Heavenly Father.

#### Agents of Peace & Redemption. 

By responding in this way, believers can become agents of God’s peace and demonstrate a redemptive alternative to the world’s patterns.

#### Transforming Encounters. 

It's crucial to apply wisdom. These teachings primarily address personal responses to individual offenses. They do not negate the role of civil justice in restraining widespread evil, nor do they mean one should passively endure situations of ongoing, severe abuse without seeking safety and help for oneself or others (especially the vulnerable). The focus is on my personal reaction when I am wronged, choosing not to perpetuate the cycle of evil with more evil.

#### What Jesus is not saying.

Jesus isn't commanding here (enduring abuse, never defending family, or solving national conflicts this way).

### Application & Discussion. 

Personal reflection. Where do I struggle most with retaliation (words, actions, holding grudges, seeking revenge)?

Practical application. What specific situation am I facing where I could apply this teaching?

Kingdom perspective. How might my non-retaliatory response create space for God to work?

#### Internal Resistance. 

What is your honest, internal reaction to these commands from Jesus? Where do you feel the most resistance to applying them?

#### Modern Equivalents. 

Can you think of modern equivalents for being slapped on the cheek (publicly shamed, trolled online), sued for your tunic (unfairly criticized at work, financially exploited), or forced to go one mile (unreasonable demands from authority, inconvenient impositions)?

#### The Second Mile.

How can we cultivate a "second mile" attitude in our service at church, at home, or in our jobs, doing more than is strictly required, with a good spirit?

#### Generosity. 

How does verse 42 challenge your current practices of giving and lending? Are there areas where you could be more open-handed?

#### Wisdom in Application. 

This is key. How do we apply these teachings wisely?

When is it right to *turn the other cheek*, and when might other actions be necessary (protecting a child from harm, reporting a crime, setting healthy boundaries with a manipulative person)?

How do we discern the difference? (This often involves the motive of the heart: is my action for personal revenge, or for true justice/protection/redemption?)

#### Fear of Being Taken Advantage Of. 

This is a real fear. How do we overcome the fear that living this way will just lead to us being constantly taken advantage of? (Focus on God's sovereignty, our ultimate security in Him, and the power of a transformed life as a witness).

#### Small Steps. 

What is one small step you could take this week to practice non-retaliation or proactive generosity in a situation where your natural instinct would be different?

### Closing Prayer.

Father God, Your ways are so much higher than our ways. This teaching of Jesus challenges us to the core of our being and our desire for what we think is "fair."

Lord, forgive us for the times we have responded to evil with more evil, for harboring resentment, or for seeking personal revenge.

Holy Spirit, give us supernatural strength and wisdom to live out these commands. Help us to understand when and how to turn the other cheek, to go the extra mile, and to give generously, not out of weakness, but out of the strength and love of Christ.

May our responses to those who wrong us break cycles of bitterness and instead point them towards Your goodness and grace. Transform our hearts so that we increasingly reflect the character of Jesus, who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return.

In His powerful name, we pray. Amen.
