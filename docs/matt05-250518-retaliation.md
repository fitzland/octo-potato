# Retaliation & Redemption
**Matthew 5:38-42**

## Introduction

### Structure/Outline

Manifesto of the King

1.  Citizens of the Kingdom (ch 5)
    1.  Quality (1-12)
    2.  Function (13-16)
    3.  _Motive (17-48)_
2.  Values of the Kingdom (ch 6)
3.  Relationship with the Kingdom (ch 7)

### Context

We are studying the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7). Jesus teaches us about life in the Kingdom of Heaven. As He lays out the ethics and righteousness expected of citizens in the Kingdom of Heaven.

Jesus used the following pattern:

|   Traditional Understanding   |   Deeper Understanding   |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------- |
|   _You have heard it said…_   |   _But I say to you…_    |
|   a traditional understanding of a principle or law   |   a deeper meaning that God intended we understand   |

And, He's raising the standard from **outward conformity** to **inward transformation**.

#### A Review of the Last Few Passages
- Jesus didn’t come to _abolish_ the Law, but rather to **fulfill**.
- Our righteousness must _exceed_ that of the Pharisees.
- Our internal _anger_ can lead to outward **murder**.
- Our _lust_ is actually **adultery** of the heart.
- Divorce is not _encouraged_, but **allowed** and it’s not just because someone is _displeasing_.
- Our speech should be _truthful_, _consistent_ and _reliable_.

#### In this passage

Jesus challenges the common understanding of justice (*an eye for an eye*) and calls His disciples to a radical new way of responding to evil and personal offenses—one that involves non-retaliation and proactive generosity.

**NOTE**. Jesus is not telling us to _enable_ abuse, _ignore_ systemic injustice, or _fail to protect_ the vulnerable. He is addressing our _personal_, _individual_ response to being wronged.

His teaching prioritizes God's _redemptive purposes_ over **personal rights** or **vengeance**. He's telling us to respond to evil not with passive acceptance, but with creative, dignity-preserving alternatives that can transform situations and hearts.

### Icebreaker
!!! question "Discussion Question"
    Think about a time you were treated unfairly or someone wronged you personally. What was your immediate, gut reaction? What did you want to do?

    How does society (or even **our own instincts**) tell us we should respond when our rights are violated or we are attacked?

## 1. What the Law Actually Taught

!!! quote "Matthew 5:38, BSB"
    You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’

### What was the Old Testament basis?

It was the principle of _Lex Talionis_ (Latin for law of retaliation), which is found in several Old Testament passages.

- [`Exodus 21:23-25`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/21.htm#23). But if there is serious injury, you are to take _life for life_, _eye for eye_, _tooth for tooth_...
- [`Leviticus 24:19-20`](https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24.htm#19). If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him: _fracture for fracture_, _eye for eye_, _tooth for tooth_.
- [`Deuteronomy 19:21`](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm). Show no pity: _life for life_, _eye for eye_, _tooth for tooth_...

### What was the purpose of this principle?

- **Limiting Vengeance.** Primarily, it was designed to limit and restrict personal revenge and escalating blood feuds. It set an upper limit on retailiation.
- **Ensuring Public Justice, Not Personal Revenge.** The principle was intended for magistrates and judges in a civil court setting to ensure fair and equitable justice.
- **Upholding the Value of Each Person.** By demanding equal retribution, it implicitly stated that all individuals had equal value.

### How was the principle misinterpreted or misapplied? 

By Jesus' day, this principle was being used to justify _personal retaliation_ and a spirit of vengeance, rather than being seen as a guide for _civic justice_ administered by authorities. People might have felt they had a **right** to exact personal revenge on a one-for-one basis.

!!! question "Discussion Question"
    Can we see how easily a principle designed for societal justice can be twisted to justify personal revenge?

## 2. A Different Response to Evil

!!! quote "Matthew 5:39a, BSB"
    But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.

### Distinct Shift
**But I tell you**. signals Jesus' divine authority and a profound shift in perspective for His followers.

### Command Explained
- **do not resist**. (Grk. _anthistēmi_) means to stand against, oppose, or resist, often in a direct, confrontational, or retaliatory way.
- **evil person**. refers to someone who is actively doing wrong or causing harm, particularly to the believer.

**NOTE**. Jesus is talking about not retaliating against a *person who does evil* to you, not about being passive towards *evil itself* or demonic influence.

### Initial Impact and Implication
This command is shocking and counter-intuitive. It seems to suggest passivity in the face of wrongdoing.

!!! question "Discussion Question"
    How does this command strike you initially?

Jesus is calling His disciples to voluntarily lay down their right to personal retaliation when wronged. This isn't about denying that evil exists, but about choosing a radically different way to respond to it.

## 3. Jesus Gives Practical Examples

Jesus provides four concrete examples of what this non-resistance looks like in everyday life.

!!! question "Discussion Question"
    Can you think of modern parallels for each one?

### Turning the Other Cheek
> [`Matthew 5:39b`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm). If anyone slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.

A slap on the right cheek (typically with the back of the right hand) was a profound insult and act of contempt in that culture. By turning the other cheek, you weren't inviting further abuse, but standing with dignity and requiring the aggressor to treat you as an equal if they struck again.

!!! question "Discussion Question"
    When have you been tempted to let the negativity of someone else drag you down to their level?

- [`Romans 12:17-21`](https://biblehub.com/romans/12.htm#17). Do not repay anyone evil for evil... overcome evil with good
- [`1 Peter 2:21-23`](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2.htm#21). Christ's example of not retaliating when insulted.

#### Jesus tells us… 
Instead of retaliating for this affront to one's dignity, Jesus says to offer the other cheek. This is a courageous act to break the cycle of insult and retaliation, potentially disarming the aggressor.

#### What it does…
This is a refusal to let the evil person dictate the terms of the encounter. It's about maintaining one's own Christ-like composure and offering a different way.

### Giving the Tunic (Cloak) 
> [`Matthew 5:40`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-40.htm). And if anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.

The **tunic** was the inner garment. The **cloak** was the outer garment, often used as a blanket at night and more valuable. Under Jewish law ([`Exodus 22:26-27`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/22.htm#26)), a creditor could not permanently keep a poor man's cloak.

!!! question "Discussion Question"
    How attached are we to our possessions, to the point that we would fight tooth and nail?

#### Jesus tells us… 
If someone is so determined to exploit you legally that they sue for your basic tunic, go beyond what they demand and offer your more valuable cloak as well. This is startling, absurd, generosity.

#### What it does…
This demonstrates a detachment from material possessions. It changes the dynamic, highlighting the exploiter's greed by an unexpected act of sacrificial giving.

### Going the Second Mile
> [`Matthew 5:41`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-41.htm). If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two.

**forces**. (Grk. _angareuō_) refers to a Roman practice where a soldier could legally compel a civilian to carry his pack for one Roman mile. This was a constant reminder of their subjugation.

!!! question "Discussion Question"
    Where in your life do you feel forced or obligated?

> [`Philippians 2:3-4`](https://biblehub.com/philippians/2.htm#3). In humility consider others better than yourselves.

#### Jesus tells us… 
Instead of begrudgingly complying, Jesus says to willingly go a second mile.

#### What it does… 
This transforms an act of forced servitude into an act of voluntary, cheerful service. It reclaims agency and can baffle the oppressor, demonstrating a spirit that cannot be crushed.

### Giving and Loaning Freely
> [`Matthew 5:42`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-42.htm). Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

This extends the principle of generosity beyond responses to direct antagonism to a general posture toward those in need.

!!! question "Discussion Question"
    How does our willingness to be generous reflect our trust in God as Provider?

- [`2 Corinthians 9:6-8`](https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9.htm#6). God loves a cheerful giver.
- [`Proverbs 19:17`](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-17.htm). Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD.

#### Jesus tells us… 
Followers of Christ should be characterized by a willingness to give and lend without a grudging spirit.

#### What it does…
This reflects the generous heart of God Himself ([`Matthew 5:45`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm)). It cultivates a spirit of mercy and reliance on God as our ultimate provider.

**NOTE**. This presumes that the needs are genuine. Augustine said give _to everyone_ that asks, not give _everything_ to him that asks.

## 4. Kingdom Principles at Play

- **Beyond Mere Passivity.** We are called to proactive, often startling, responses that break cycles of violence, greed, and oppression.
- **Overcoming Evil with Good.** The goal is not just to absorb wrong, but to introduce a transformative element into the situation. ([`Romans 12:21`](https://biblehub.com/romans/12-21.htm))
- **Reflecting the Character of God.** Our ethic should reflect the merciful, patient, and generous character of God the Father.
- **Witness and Potential for Transformation.** Such unexpected responses can act as a powerful witness, potentially changing the heart of the wrongdoer.
- **Surrendering Personal Rights.** We are asked to surrender what we might consider our personal *rights* for the sake of Kingdom purpose.
- **Breaking Cycles.** Retaliation breeds more retaliation. Jesus offers a way to stop the destructive cycle.

### The Goal: Why This Radical Call?
- **Reflect the Father.** This behavior is rooted in imitating the character of our Heavenly Father.
- **Agents of Peace & Redemption.** By responding in this way, believers can become agents of God’s peace.

**NOTE:** The focus is on my personal reaction when I am wronged, choosing not to perpetuate the cycle of evil. This does not negate the role of civil justice or the need to protect the vulnerable.

## Application & Discussion 

!!! question "Discussion Question"
    What is your honest, internal reaction to these commands from Jesus? Where do you feel the most resistance to applying them?

!!! question "Discussion Question"
    Can you think of modern equivalents for being slapped on the cheek (publicly shamed, trolled online), sued for your tunic (unfairly criticized at work, financially exploited), or forced to go one mile (unreasonable demands from authority)?

!!! question "Discussion "
    How can we cultivate a "second mile" attitude in our service at church, at home, or in our jobs, doing more than is strictly required, with a good spirit?

!!! question "Discussion Question"
    How does verse 42 challenge your current practices of giving and lending?

!!! question "Discussion Question"
    How do we apply these teachings wisely? When is it right to *turn the other cheek*, and when might other actions be necessary (e.g., protecting a child from harm)?

    What is one small step you could take this week to practice non-retaliation or proactive generosity in a situation where your natural instinct would be different?

## Closing Prayer

God, Your ways are so much higher than our ways. This teaching challenges us to the core of our being and our desire for what we think is _fair_. Forgive us for the times we have responded to evil with more evil, for harboring resentment, or for seeking personal revenge.

Give us supernatural strength and wisdom to live out these commands. Help us to understand when and how to turn the other cheek, to go the extra mile, and to give generously, not out of weakness, but out of the strength and love of Christ.

May our responses to those who wrong us break cycles of bitterness and instead point them towards Your goodness and grace. Transform our hearts so that we increasingly reflect the character of Jesus, who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return. Amen.
