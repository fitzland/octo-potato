# The Pursuit of Godliness

1 Timothy 4:6-16, BSB

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

What’s the difference between being “religious” and being “godly”? Can you be one without the other?

Our culture often views "being religious" as focusing on external rules and rituals, which can sometimes be performed with little heart change. Godliness, on the other hand, is the internal orientation of a heart that actively desires to please and reflect God. While we can certainly be religious without being godly (Pharisees are a good example), it's difficult to be truly godly without the valuable structures often associated with religion: discipline, community, and a commitment to truth. This lesson is about moving beyond empty ritual to the heart of our faith: a disciplined pursuit of God Himself.

### Series Overview

For six weeks, we're in a series called **Character Counts**.

- **Session 1**. Importance of Character (2 Peter 1:1-11) – Equipped for Christlike character
- **Session 2**. Godliness (1 Timothy 4:6-16) – Point others to Christ
- **Session 3**. Humility (Philippians 2:1-11) – Consider the needs of others
- **Session 4**. Contentment (Philippians 4:10-20) – Find satisfaction in Christ
- **Session 5**. Generosity (2 Corinthians 8:1-9) – Give from what God has given us
- **Session 6**. Integrity (1 Peter 3:8-17) – Live consistently with our confession

### Historical Context

Paul writes this letter to his young protégé, Timothy, who is leading the church in Ephesus—a city filled with pagan idolatry, philosophical speculation, and spiritual confusion. False teachers were infiltrating the church, promoting "myths and endless genealogies" (1 Tim. 1:4), forbidding marriage, and demanding abstinence from certain foods (1 Tim. 4:3). These teachings were a dangerous mix of legalism and Gnosticism, promising a higher spirituality through secret knowledge and ascetic practices.

Paul's instruction to Timothy is intensely practical. He's not just correcting bad doctrine; he's training a young leader how to cultivate a healthy church. The antidote to false teaching isn't just more teaching; it's a life of authentic godliness.

### Modern Context

Today, we face a similar spiritual marketplace. We're bombarded with ideas that sound spiritual but lack substance, fad diets for the soul, and self-help gurus promising enlightenment. Many want the benefits of spirituality—like peace and meaning—without the commitments of the faith, such as discipline, community, and submission to God's Word. From wellness trends that mimic spiritual practices to political ideologies that demand total allegiance, many things compete for our devotion.

Paul’s message to Timothy cuts through the noise: Don't get distracted by spiritual junk food. True transformation doesn't come from asceticism or esoteric knowledge, but from disciplined training in godliness, fueled by the hope of the gospel.

### Core Message

A godly life points others to Christ.

## 1. A Godly Life Must Be Our Priority

We must reject spiritual distractions and actively train ourselves for a life that reflects God.

### 1 Timothy 4:6-8, BSB

> **6** If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed. **7** But have nothing to do with pointless and silly myths. Rather, train yourself in godliness. **8** For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.

### Context & Insights

-   **Good Minister vs. False Teachers**. Paul contrasts the "good minister," who is "nourished on the truths of the faith," with the false teachers and their "pointless and silly myths." The word for myths (*mythois*) refers to fabricated stories. Paul dismisses them as worthless distractions. A faithful leader's diet is Scripture, and their job is to serve that nourishing food to others.

-   **Train Yourself in Godliness**. Paul uses an athletic metaphor. "Train yourself" comes from the Greek word *gymnazō*, from which we get "gymnasium." It implies rigorous, disciplined, and intentional effort. Godliness is not a passive state; it's an active pursuit. It's something we must *train* for, like an athlete preparing for a competition. **Illustration**. *An athlete doesn't hope they'll be in shape for the Olympics; they have a detailed training plan. Our spiritual growth requires a similar level of intentionality.*

-   **Spiritual vs. Physical Training**. Paul doesn't dismiss physical training; he affirms it has *some value*. But he immediately puts it in perspective. Godliness has value for *all things*. Physical fitness benefits our earthly bodies for a short time. Godliness benefits our whole person—body and soul—for all eternity. It holds a promise for the present life (peace, purpose, etc.) and the life to come (eternal reward). *As the saying goes, "it's better to be fat and godly, than religious and trim."*

### Pointless Myths

> Paul tells Timothy to avoid "pointless and silly myths." What are some modern-day "spiritual myths" or distractions that can pull Christians away from genuine godliness?

**The "Prosperity Gospel" Myth**. The idea that faith is a tool to get health, wealth, and personal happiness. It exchanges the pursuit of godliness for the pursuit of comfort and material gain.

**The "Be True to Yourself" Myth**. The belief that the highest good is to follow your own heart and desires, rather than submitting your will to God's. This is the opposite of godly self-denial.

**The "Spiritual but not Religious" Myth**. This often means wanting the benefits of spirituality (peace, meaning) without the commitment, discipline, and community that are vital for genuine godliness. It seeks godliness without the necessary "gymnazō" (training).

**The "Activism is Godliness" Myth**. While social justice can be an expression of faith, this myth equates political or social activism *with* godliness itself, often leading to self-righteousness and burnout when not grounded in the gospel.

### Reflection (Heart)

> **Personal Audit**. What "training regimen" currently dominates your life? Is it training for a better career? A better body? A better hobby? How does your effort in those areas compare to your effort in training for godliness?

*Transition*. Paul has established the priority of training in godliness. Next, he reveals the motivation that fuels this difficult, lifelong pursuit.

## 2. A Godly Life Is Grounded in Hope

The tireless work of pursuing godliness is fueled by our secure hope in the living God who saves all people.

### 1 Timothy 4:9-11, BSB

> **9** This is a trustworthy saying, worthy of full acceptance. **10** To this end we labor and strive, because we have fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe. **11** Command and teach these things.

### Context & Insights

-   **Labor and Strive**. Paul uses two strong words to describe the Christian life: "labor" (*kopiōmen*), suggesting wearying toil, and "strive" (*agōnizometha*), meaning to contend or fight like an athlete. This is not a casual stroll. Pursuing godliness is hard work. Why do it? Because our hope is not in our own efforts, but in a powerful, external reality.

-   **Hope on the Living God**. Our motivation is not the training itself, but the object of our hope: the *living God*. This contrasts sharply with the dead idols and empty philosophies of Ephesus. We are not striving to earn favor from a distant deity; we are responding to a relationship with the God who is alive and active.

-   **Savior of All People**. This is a potentially confusing phrase. Does it mean everyone will be saved (universalism)? No. The rest of Scripture is clear that faith in Christ is necessary for salvation. "All people" means God's salvation is not limited to a specific ethnicity or group (like the Jews). His offer of salvation is universally available. He is the *potential* Savior of all, but the *actual* Savior of "those who believe." **Illustration**. *A hospital may have a cure available to everyone in the city ("the cure for all people"), but it only works for those who actually come to the hospital and receive it ("especially of those who get treated").*

### Fixing Our Hope

> How does fixing our hope on "the living God" empower us to "labor and strive" in the pursuit of godliness, especially when we feel weary or discouraged?

**It Provides a Secure Foundation**. Our hope isn't in our performance, our feelings, or our circumstances, all of which are unstable. It's on God Himself, who is "living" and unchanging. This gives us stability when life is shaking.

**It Gives Purpose to the Pain**. The "labor and striving" feel meaningful when we know it's "to this end"—the end of pleasing a God who is real, who sees us, and who has promised us eternal life.

**It Reframes Failure**. When we fail, our hope in God means that failure is not the end. The "Savior... of those who believe" is there to pick us up, forgive us, and strengthen us to continue. Our hope is in His saving work, not our perfect striving.

**It Energizes Us**. Hope is a powerful motivator. Knowing that our struggle is not in vain and that our God is a "living God" actively working for our good gives us the strength to keep going.

### Reflection (Heart)

> **Hope Check**. Is your hope truly fixed on the living God, or is it subtly shifting to your own performance, your reputation, or the approval of others? Where are you tempted to find your ultimate security and worth?

*Transition*. Paul has shown that godliness is a priority to be trained for, and a struggle fueled by hope. Now, he explains how this personal pursuit has a powerful public impact.

## 3. A Godly Life Encourages Others

Your personal growth in godliness serves as a powerful example that gives you the credibility to teach and lead others.

### 1 Timothy 4:12-16, BSB

> **12** Let no one despise your youth, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity. **13** Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, and to teaching. **14** Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given you through prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you.
>
> **15** Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. **16** Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.

### Context & Insights

-   **Set an Example**. Timothy was young, and in a culture that revered age, this was a liability. Paul's solution wasn't to argue for Timothy's authority, but for Timothy to *demonstrate* it through his character. He was to become an *example* (*typos* - a pattern or model) in five key areas: speech, conduct (lifestyle), love (agape), faith (faithfulness), and purity. His life was to be his primary sermon.

-   **Public Ministry and Private Gifting**. Paul balances the public-facing aspects of ministry (public reading of Scripture, exhortation, teaching) with a reminder of Timothy's personal, God-given gift. Ministry is not just a performance; it flows from an internal gifting, affirmed by the church community ("when the council of elders laid their hands on you").

-   **Visible Progress**. Paul tells Timothy to be so diligent that "everyone may see your progress." This is a stunning command. We often try to hide our weaknesses and project an image of having it all together. Paul advocates for a visible, tangible, ongoing process of growth. This authenticity is what gives our leadership credibility. **Illustration**. *It's more inspiring to watch a fellow runner train hard and improve their time than to listen to a retired champion talk about their old victories.*

-   **Watch Your Life and Doctrine**. Paul yokes character ("life") and belief ("doctrine") together. They are inseparable. Sound doctrine without a godly life is hypocrisy. A "good" life without sound doctrine is rootless and will eventually wither. Persevering in both is the key to salvation—not in the sense of earning it, but in the sense of working out the salvation God has already given, and in so doing, pointing others to the Savior.

### Your Progress

> Paul told Timothy to let everyone see his "progress." Why is visible progress in godliness often more encouraging to others than a projected image of perfection?

**It Makes Godliness Seem Attainable**. Perfection is intimidating and feels impossible. But "progress" suggests a journey that we can all be on. It says, "I'm not there yet, but I'm moving forward, and you can too."

**It Shows the Power of the Gospel**. A perfect person doesn't need grace. A person who is visibly growing—struggling, repenting, and changing—is a walking advertisement for the transforming power of God. Their progress proves that the gospel is real.

**It Creates Authenticity and Trust**. People are tired of hypocrisy. When leaders are honest about their struggles and allow their "progress" to be seen, it builds trust. It shows they are fellow travelers, not just tour guides.

**It Encourages Vulnerability in Others**. If a leader is willing to be a "work in progress," it creates a safe space for others to be honest about their own struggles, leading to a healthier and more authentic community.

### Reflection (Heart)

> **Honest Assessment**. Are you allowing others to see your "progress," or are you trying to maintain an image of spiritual perfection or strength? In what area of your life could you be more honest about your journey of growth?

## Closing

### Decision (Will)

- **Training Commitment**. Will you commit to "train yourself in godliness" with the same intentionality you might give to your job, your health, or your hobbies?
- **Hope Adjustment**. Will you consciously "fix your hope on the living God" as the fuel for your spiritual life, especially when you feel tired or discouraged?

### Challenges (Practice)

1.  **Identify Your "Myth"**. What is one "pointless myth" or spiritual distraction that consumes your time and energy? Name it, and create a specific plan to "have nothing to do with it" this week.

2.  **Schedule Your "Gym" Time**. Identify one specific spiritual discipline you will "train" in this week (e.g., prayer, Scripture memory, silence, service). Put it on your calendar, just like you would a workout or an important meeting.

3.  **Make Progress Visible**. Choose one person in your life with whom you can be more authentic about your spiritual journey. Share with them one area where you are seeking to grow, and ask them to pray for you.

4.  **Memory Verse**. Memorize 1 Timothy 4:8 – "For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come."

### Prayer

> Heavenly Father,
>
> We confess that we often chase after pointless myths and neglect the simple, powerful call to godliness. We train for everything except the one thing that has value for all things. Forgive us for our misplaced priorities and our spiritual laziness.
>
> We thank You that our hope is not in our striving, but on You, the living God and our Savior. Energize our weary souls with this hope. Help us to labor and strive, not in our own strength, but in the power that You provide.
>
s> Let our progress be visible, not for our own glory, but so that others might be encouraged and pointed to Christ. Help us to watch our life and our doctrine closely, and to persevere in them, for our good and for the salvation of those who hear.
>
> In Jesus' name. Amen.
