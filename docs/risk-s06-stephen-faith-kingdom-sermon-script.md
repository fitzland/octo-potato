title: 'Stephen: The Extraordinary Power of Spirit-Filled Service (Sermon Script)'
---

### [INTRO - Appx. 0:00-2:30]

**(Start with a warm, welcoming tone)**

Hello, and welcome. I’m so glad you’ve joined me today.

Have you ever felt like your life was just… ordinary? You wake up, you go to work, you take care of your family, you handle your responsibilities. You do good things, but you wonder if they have any real, lasting impact. You wonder if God can truly use your ordinary, everyday life to do something… extraordinary.

The story we’re looking at today tells us the answer is a resounding 'YES'. But it comes with a twist. It’s not about graduating from ordinary tasks to so-called "REAL" ministry. It’s about understanding that **the Spirit of God makes *all* service extraordinary.**

We’re going to be looking at the story of a man named Stephen, found in the book of Acts, chapter 6. The core message for us today is this: **Bold faith, expressed through Spirit-filled service and witness, advances God's kingdom, often producing amazing results right in the middle of fierce opposition.**

You can grab your Bible, or just listen along, as we dive into Acts chapter 6.

**[PAUSE]**

### [PART 1: THE PROBLEM & THE PEOPLE - Appx. 2:30-8:00]

Our story begins with a problem. The early church in Jerusalem is exploding. It’s growing so fast, it’s having growing pains. Acts chapter 6 tells us that the Greek-speaking believers felt their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.

Now, this could have torn the church apart. It was a legitimate complaint. An administrative headache. But it was also a spiritual threat. How did the apostles handle it?

Let's pick it up in verse 3. The apostles say:

> "Brothers, therefore, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task. But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”

Did you catch the qualifications? They didn’t say, "Find us seven guys who are great with numbers." Or "Find seven people with business degrees." They said, "Find seven men of *good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom.*"

Isn't that fascinating? For a practical, administrative job—waiting tables, essentially—the number one requirement was spiritual character. Why?

**[PAUSE. Let the question hang]**

Because the early church understood a fundamental truth that maybe we’ve forgotten. They knew that all tasks in God's kingdom are spiritual. Even *administrative* work, when done by people filled with the Spirit, becomes a ministry. It builds unity. It reflects God’s character. It solves problems with a wisdom that goes beyond mere efficiency.

So, the church chose seven men. And the first one on the list is our guy: "Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit."

He was chosen to solve a food distribution problem. A practical task. And this is key: this task wasn't a distraction from the ministry; *it was the ministry*. God was about to use his faithfulness in this vital, hands-on work as a launchpad for something even wider.

It makes you wonder, doesn't it? What is the seemingly *ordinary* task in your life right now? At work, at home, in your community, at church? What if you started to see that task not just as a duty, but as a divinely appointed opportunity—not as a stepping stone, but as the main event?

**[PAUSE]**

### [PART 2: THE RESULT - Appx. 8:00-11:00]

So, they appoint these seven men, including Stephen. And the practical problem gets solved. What happens next? **Verse 7** gives us this incredible little progress report. It says:

> "So the word of God spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased significantly. And a large number of priests became obedient to the faith."

Let's pause on that last part for a second. A large number of *priests*. Why does that matter so much? Because these weren't just random people. These were the ultimate religious insiders, the gatekeepers of the temple system, whose entire livelihood and social standing were tied to the very thing the followers of Jesus were challenging. For them to become *obedient to the faith* was a major shift. It meant giving up their special position and importance. It was a powerful sign that God's kingdom was truly on the move. Further, its *truth* could capture the hearts of people most set in their ways. No one was beyond its reach.

This shows us what happens when we combine practical service with bold witness. It creates a testimony that breaks through social and religious barriers we might think are impossible to overcome. It reminds us that when the church is healthy on the inside, it becomes an unstoppable force on the outside.

**[PAUSE, TRANSITION]**

But as we all know, when God's kingdom advances, it often meets resistance. And that's exactly where Stephen's story goes next.

### [PART 3: THE POWER & THE PERSECUTION - Appx. 11:00-18:00]

The man who was chosen to wait tables is now doing something else. Look at verse 8:

> "Now Stephen, full of grace and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people."

The same Spirit that made him a wise administrator now empowers him as a powerful evangelist. He starts debating with some of the Jewish leaders, and they are no match for him. Listen to verse **Verse 10**:

> "But they could not stand up to his wisdom or the Spirit by whom he spoke."

He was unstoppable. Now, why does truth often provoke such a hostile reaction? Because when a clear, undeniable truth confronts a person's power, their worldview, or their comfort, and they can't refute it with logic or facts, their only remaining weapons are often fear, slander, and personal attacks. If you can't defeat the message, you try to destroy the messenger.

And that's exactly what happened to Stephen.

They couldn't win the argument, so they started a smear campaign. They secretly coerced people to lie, saying "We heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God." They stirred up the crowds, seized Stephen, and dragged him before the Sanhedrin—the same high court that condemned Jesus.

He's on trial for his life. The accusations are flying. And in this moment of intense pressure, the Bible gives us this interesting detail in **verse 15**:

> "And everyone who was sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen and saw that his face was like the face of an angel."

Can you picture that? In the face of lies, hatred, and mortal danger, he is so filled with God's presence and peace that his face literally shines.

And with that angelic face, that supernatural calm, Stephen doesn't stay silent. This moment becomes the prelude to his powerful sermon in Acts chapter 7, where he boldly recounts Israel's history of rejecting God's messengers. He holds them accountable, speaking the hard truth in love—an act of ultimate faithfulness that would lead directly to his death. He used his platform not for self-preservation, but for proclamation.

Where does that kind of peace and courage come from? It comes from a deep, settled trust in the presence and power of God.

Now, most of us won't stand trial before a high court. But we will face opposition? The skeptical coworker, the eye-roll from a family member, a dismissive comment online. Stephen’s example challenges us to cultivate a character that leans *so heavily* on God's presence that we can respond with peace, even under pressure.

**[PAUSE]**

### [CONCLUSION & CHALLENGE - Appx. 18:00-22:00]

Stephen's story is a powerful, challenging journey. From Spirit-filled service at tables to Spirit-filled witness before the court, and ultimately, a martyr. He shows us that all service done in the Spirit is extraordinary and has a kingdom impact.

So, as we close, how do we apply this? I want to leave you with three challenges.

First: **See the holy in your ordinary.** That task you think is just a task? God sees it as a sacred opportunity. Whether it's being honest on your paperwork, patiently teaching a child in at a *Good News Club*, or caring for an aging parent with grace when you're exhausted—that is your kingdom work. Embrace it as HOLY.

Second: **Find your voice.** Opposition can make us quiet. Fear can make us passive. Ask the Holy Spirit for the wisdom and courage to speak up for truth and grace, whether you're in a office or at the dinner table.

And finally: **Take one faithful risk.** Faith isn't a feeling; it's an action. What is one concrete step God is asking you to take this week that feels like a risk? It might be small. But it's a step. Take it.

Don't underestimate the power of a life, just one ordinary life, fully surrendered to the Spirit of God.

### [PRAYER - Appx. 22:00-24:00]

Let's pray together.

Heavenly Father, we thank You for the inspiring example of Stephen, a man full of Your Spirit and wisdom. We confess that too often we distinguish between *small* and *great* tasks, forgetting that all service, when done for Your glory, is sacred. Forgive us for our fears that keep us silent when we should speak, and for our defensiveness when confronted with opposition.

We pray that You would fill us with Your grace and power, just as You filled Stephen. Help us to serve faithfully in every role You give us, whether at tables or in public witness. Grant us courage to speak Your truth with wisdom, even when it leads to opposition, trusting that Your presence will sustain us and Your Spirit will speak through us. May our character shine brightly under pressure, reflecting Your glory to a watching world.

Empower us, Lord, to embrace the risks of obedience, knowing that true fruitfulness often comes through faithfully enduring opposition. May we live in such a way that our lives bring You honor, and may Your kingdom advance through our Spirit-led service and bold witness. In Jesus' mighty name we pray. Amen.
