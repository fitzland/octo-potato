# Pursuit of Godliness

1 Timothy 4:6-16, BSB

## Introduction

### Series Overview

We're in a series called **Character Counts**.

- **1**. Importance of Character (2 Peter 1:1-11) – Equipped for Christlike character
- **2**. *Godliness* (1 Timothy 4:6-16) – Point others to Christ
- **3**. Humility (Philippians 2:1-11) – Consider the needs of others

- **6**. Integrity (1 Peter 3:8-17) – Live consistently with our confession

### Core Message

A godly life points others to Christ.

### Lesson Flow

1. [**Priority of a Godliness**]
2. [**A Godly Life Is Grounded in Hope**]
3. [**A Godly Life Encourages Others**]

### Icebreaker

> What's the difference between being *religious* and being *godly*? 
> Can you be one without the other?

[Allow discussion - listen for: external vs. internal, rules vs. relationship, ritual vs. heart]

**Synthesis**. Our culture often views *being religious* as focusing on external rules and rituals, which can be performed with little heart change. Godliness, on the other hand, is an internal orientation—a heart that actively desires to please and reflect God. 

While we can certainly be religious without being godly (the Pharisees are a prime example), it's difficult to be genuinely godly without some of the structures religion provides: discipline, community, and commitment to truth. 

Today we'll talk about moving beyond empty ritual to an authentic life of godliness that point others Christ.

### Historical Context

Paul writes this letter to his young protégé, Timothy, who is leading the church in Ephesus—a city filled with pagan idolatry, philosophical speculation, and spiritual confusion. False teachers were infiltrating the church, promoting "myths and endless genealogies" (1 Tim. 1:4), forbidding marriage, and demanding abstinence from certain foods (1 Tim. 4:3). These teachings were a dangerous mix of legalism and Gnosticism, promising a higher spirituality through secret knowledge and ascetic practices.

Paul's instruction to Timothy is intensely practical. He's not just correcting bad doctrine; he's training a young leader how to cultivate a healthy church. The antidote to false teaching isn't just more teaching; it's a life of authentic godliness.

### Modern Context

Today, we face a similar spiritual marketplace. We're bombarded with ideas that sound spiritual but lack substance, fad diets for the soul, and self-help gurus promising enlightenment. Many want the benefits of spirituality—like peace and meaning—without the commitments of the faith, such as discipline, community, and submission to God's Word. From wellness trends that mimic spiritual practices to political ideologies that demand total allegiance, many things compete for our devotion.

Paul’s cuts through the noise: Don't get distracted by spiritual junk food. True transformation doesn't come from asceticism or esoteric knowledge, but from disciplined training in godliness, fueled by the hope of the gospel.


## 1. Priority of a Godly Life

We must reject spiritual distractions and actively train ourselves for a life that reflects God.

### 1 Timothy 4:6-8, BSB

> **6** If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed. **7** But have nothing to do with pointless and silly myths. Rather, train yourself in godliness. **8** For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.

### Observe & Discuss (Mind)

> What does Paul tell Timothy to avoid (v.7)? 

[pointless things]

> What does he call these things?

[silly myths - fabricated stories]

> What does he tell Timothy to do instead? 

[train yourself in godliness] 

> What specific word does he use?

[*gymnazō*]

> What comparison does Paul make (v.8)? 

[physical training vs. godliness] 

> Why does he say godliness is so much more valuable?

[some value vs. all things; body vs. soul; temporary vs. eternal]

### Key Insights

**Good Minister vs. False Teachers**
- Nourished on truth vs. peddling pointless myths
- Scripture is the diet; serve it to others

**Train in Godliness**
- *Gymnazō* (gymnasium) = rigorous, disciplined effort
- Not passive; requires intentional training plan
- **Illustration:** Olympic athletes don't hope - they train

**Spiritual vs. Physical**
- Physical: *some* value (body, temporary)
- Godliness: *all things* (soul, eternal)

### Apply to Today (Mind)

> What are some modern *spiritual myths* or *distractions* that pull Christians away from genuine godliness?

[Prosperity Gospel, True to Yourself, Spirituality without Religion, Activism = Godliness]

### Heart Check (Reflection)

> What training regimen dominates your time and energy right now? 

> If godliness requires the same intentionality as physical training, where does it rank in your actual schedule?

*Transition:* Paul has shown us the priority. Now he reveals the fuel that powers this lifelong pursuit.

## 2. Grounded in Hope

The tireless work of pursuing godliness is fueled by our secure hope in the living God who saves all people.

### 1 Timothy 4:9-11, BSB

> **9** This is a trustworthy saying, worthy of full acceptance. **10** To this end we labor and strive, because we have fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe. **11** Command and teach these things.

### Observe & Discuss (Mind)

> What two strong words does Paul use to describe the Christian life (v.10)?

[labor and strive - both intense, exhausting words]

> Why does Paul say we do this hard work? Where is our hope fixed?

[on the living God - not dead idols, not our own effort]

> Look at how God is described. What titles or descriptions does Paul give Him?

[living God, Savior of all people, especially those who believe]

> The phrase *Savior of all people, especially of those who believe* can be confusing. What do you think Paul means?

[Universal offer, not universal salvation; available to all, effective for believers; not limited to Jews]

### Key Insights

**Labor and Strive**
- *Kopiōmen* = wearying toil
- *Agōnizometha* = contend, fight like an athlete
- This is **not** a casual spiritual stroll

**Hope on the Living God**
- Contrast: dead idols vs. the **living** God
- Not earning favor; responding to relationship
- External reality, not internal effort

**Savior of All People**
- Not universalism (everyone saved)
- Universal availability (offer to all)
- Actual Savior of those who believe
- Gospel breaks ethnic/group barriers

### Apply to Today (Discussion: Mind)

> How does fixing our hope on *the living God* empower us to *labor and strive* in godliness, especially when we feel weary or discouraged?

[Possible answers:]

- **Secure Foundation**. hope in unchanging God, not performance/feelings/circumstances
- **Purpose to Pain**. struggle is meaningful when directed toward a real, living God
- **Reframes Failure**. the Savior picks us up, forgives, strengthens; not the end
- **Energizes Us**. hope is powerful fuel; our struggle is not in vain

### Heart Check (Reflection)

> When the spiritual life feels exhausting, where does your hope actually land?
 
> Is it fixed on God, or has it drifted to your own performance, others' approval, or favorable circumstances?

*Transition:* Paul has shown that godliness is a priority to train for, and a struggle fueled by hope. Now he explains how this personal pursuit has powerful public impact.

## 3. Godliness Encourages Others

Your personal growth in godliness serves as a powerful example that gives you credibility to teach and lead others.

### 1 Timothy 4:12-16, BSB

> **12** Let no one despise your youth, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity. **13** Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, and to teaching. **14** Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given you through prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you.

> **15** Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. **16** Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.

### Observe & Discuss (Mind)

> Timothy was young in a culture that revered age. What was Paul's solution to this liability?

[Don't argue for authority - demonstrate it through character; be an example]

> What five areas does Paul tell Timothy to be an example in?

[speech, conduct, love, faith, purity - his life is his primary sermon]

> What does Paul want everyone to see (v.15)?

[Timothy's progress - not perfection, but visible growth]

> What two things together that must be watched closely?

[life and doctrine - character and belief, inseparable]

### Key Insights

**Set an Example**
- *Typos* = pattern or model
- Five areas: speech, conduct (lifestyle), love (agape), faith (faithfulness), purity
- Life is the primary sermon

**Public Ministry, Private Gifting**
- Public: reading Scripture, exhortation, teaching
- Private: God-given gift, affirmed by community (elders)
- Ministry flows from internal gifting, not just performance

**Visible Progress**
- Not projected perfection, but authentic growth
- Everyone may see your progress - stunning transparency
- **Illustration:** More inspiring to watch a runner train and improve than hear a retired champion talk about old victories

**Life & Doctrine**
- Sound doctrine without godly life = hypocrisy
- Godly life without sound doctrine = rootless, will wither
- Persevering in both = working out salvation, pointing others to the Savior

### Apply to Today (Discussion: Mind)

> Why is visible *progress* in godliness often more encouraging to others than a projected image of perfection?

[Possible answers:]
- **Attainable**. progress feels possible; perfection feels impossible
- **Gospel Power**. perfect person doesn't need grace; growing person proves gospel is real
- **Builds Trust**. authenticity combats hypocrisy; shows you're a fellow traveler
- **Creates Safety**. leader's vulnerability invites others to be honest about their struggles

### Heart Check (Reflection)

> Are you hiding behind an image of spiritual strength, or are you letting others see your actual progress? 

> What would it cost you to be more honest about where you're still growing?

## Closing

### Decision (Will)

**Training Commitment**. Will you commit to train yourself in godliness with the same intentionality you might give to your job, your health, or your hobbies?

**Hope Adjustment**. Will you consciously fix your hope on the living God as the fuel for your spiritual life, especially when you feel tired or discouraged?

### Challenges (Practice)

**Identify Your Myth**. What is one *pointless myth* or *spiritual distraction* that consumes your time and energy? Plan to have nothing to do with it this week.

**Schedule Your Gym Time**. Identify one specific spiritual discipline you will train in this week (e.g., prayer, Scripture memory, silence, service). Put it on your calendar, just like you would a workout or an important meeting.

**Make Progress Visible**. Choose one person in your life with whom you can be more authentic about your spiritual journey. Share with them one area where you are seeking to grow, and ask them to pray for you.

**Memory Verse**. Memorize 1 Timothy 4:8 – For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.

### Prayer

> Heavenly Father,

> We confess that we often chase after pointless things and neglect the simple, powerful call to godliness. We train for everything except the one thing that has value for all things. Forgive us for our misplaced priorities and our spiritual laziness.

> We thank You that our hope is not in our striving, but on You, the living God and our Savior. Energize our weary souls with this hope. Help us to labor and strive, not in our own strength, but in the power that You provide.

s> Let our progress be visible, not for our own glory, but so that others might be encouraged and pointed to Christ. Help us to watch our life and our doctrine closely, and to persevere in them, for our good and for the salvation of those who hear.

> In Jesus' name. Amen.
