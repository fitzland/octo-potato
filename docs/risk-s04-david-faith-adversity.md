# David. Faith that Meets Adversity

[1 Samuel 17:3-8, 32-37, 45-47](https://biblehub.com/bsb/1_samuel/17.htm), BSB

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

Describe the biggest challenge or *giant* (in school, work, or life) you've ever had to face.

Society says to lower the volume of the negative voice in your head and puff up your confidence by believing in yourself to grow, adapt, and improve.

The Bible says no roadblock or giant is too much for God. When we trust Him, He works on our behalf.

*True faith doesn’t eliminate fear, but it fuels a confidence that is bigger than the challenge.*

### Core Message

Confident faith meets adversity head-on; it remembers God's past faithfulness, speaks His promises, and acts boldly in His name to achieve His victory.

## 1. Paralyzing Challenge (Seeing the Giant)

The enemy's challenge was designed to create fear and paralysis.

Adversity provides the opportunity to display our faith.

### 1 Samuel 17:3-8, BSB

> **3** The Philistines stood on one hill and the Israelites stood on another, with the valley between them. **4** Then a champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out from the Philistine camp. He was six cubits and a span in height, **5** and he had a bronze helmet on his head. He wore a bronze coat of mail weighing five thousand shekels, **6** and he had armor of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. **7** The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. In addition, his shield bearer went before him. **8** And Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and array yourselves for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose one of your men and have him come down against me."

### Context & Insights

- **Two Hills**. Two armies have gathered for battle. Each stands on a hill with the valley of Elah between them. They are not fighting; Israel is paralyzed by fear.

- **Intimidation**. The source of their fear is Goliath, a Philistine champion (man in the middle) who seems invincible and overwhelming. His height (over 9 feet), weight of his armor (125 lbs), and size of his spear were all meant to intimidate.

- **Why come out?** His taunt is designed to make Israel feel foolish and powerless. He questions their very right to be on the battlefield.

- **Servants of Saul**. He identifies them by their human king, Saul, who was also hiding in fear. He ignores their identity as the people of the living God.

- **Choose Someone**. Goliath gave Israel an easy way out: He offered to fight Israel’s best warrior. The losers would be servants of the winner, but at least they wouldn’t die on the battlefield.

### Nature of Giants

> What are the characteristics of the *giants* we face in our lives?

> How does the enemy use intimidation and taunts to paralyze us today?

#### Common Answers

**Overwhelming Size**. Giants, by nature, appear too big for us to handle. They dominate our field of vision and make us feel small and insignificant.

**Public Challenge**. They challenge us publicly, adding the fear of shame and failure to the threat.

**Identity Attack**. They question our identity in Christ, our strength, and God's ability or willingness to help, wanting us to see ourselves as orphans rather than children of the King.

### Reflection (Heart)

> What specific *taunts* are you hearing from the *giant* in your life? (e.g., "You'll never beat this," "You're not good enough," "God has abandoned you.")

*Transition*. The army saw an unbeatable giant, but a young shepherd boy, arriving on the scene, saw something else entirely.

## 2. Confident Testimony (Remembering God)

David's confidence was not in himself, but was built on a history of experiencing God's deliverance. Past experiences can grow our faith.

### 1 Samuel 17:32-37, BSB

> **32** And David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail on account of this Philistine. Your servant will go and fight him!” **33** But Saul replied, “You cannot go out against this Philistine to fight him. You are just a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth.” **34** David replied, “Your servant has been tending his father’s sheep, and whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock, **35** I went after it, struck it down, and delivered the lamb from its mouth. If it reared up against me, I would grab it by its fur, strike it down, and kill it. **36** Your servant has killed lions and bears; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.” **37** David added, “The LORD, who delivered me from the claws of the lion and the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” “Go,” said Saul, “and may the LORD be with you.”

### Context & Insights

- **just a boy**. Saul evaluates David based on outward appearance, the same way he evaluates Goliath. He sees the world's way.

- **Your servant has**. David responds with a testimony. He doesn't argue his own strength; he presents the evidence of God's past deliverances. The lion and the bear were his private training ground for this public test.

- **The LORD, who delivered me**. David connects God's past action directly to his present challenge. He has a history with God, and that history informs his future. He sees Goliath not as a new threat, but as just another *lion or bear*.

### Power of Testimony

> How did David's private faithfulness in the pasture prepare him for his public battle in the valley?

> Why is it so important to remember and recount God's past faithfulness in our lives?

#### Common Answers

**Private Victories, Public Confidence**. God often tests and proves our faith in small, private battles before He calls us to larger, public ones. Faithfulness in the *pasture* builds the spiritual muscle needed for the *valley*.

**Remembrance Builds Faith**. Remembering what God has done in the past fuels our faith for the present. It provides a library of evidence that God is both able and willing to act on our behalf. It stops us from getting *spiritual amnesia*.

**Defense Against Doubt**. When we are facing a new giant, our memory of God's past deliverances serves as a powerful defense against the taunts of fear and doubt.

### Reflection (Heart)

> How has God delivered you or shown His faithfulness in the past? What are some *lions and bears* that He has defeated?

*Transition*. Armed with a shepherd's tools and a warrior's confidence, David walks into the valley, not with a strategy of his own, but with a declaration of faith.

## 3. Victorious Stand (Acting in Faith)

Confident faith confronts the enemy not with worldly weapons, but in the name and power of the LORD. David reframes the entire conflict. This isn't about David vs. Goliath; it's about the God of Israel vs. a defiant enemy.

### 1 Samuel 17:45-47, BSB

> **45** But David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. **46** This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand. This day I will strike you down, cut off your head, and give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the creatures of the earth. Then the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. **47** And all those assembled here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD’s, and He will give all of you into our hands.”

### Context & Insights

- **You come against me**. David draws a sharp contrast between worldly power (sword, spear, javelin) and spiritual power (the name of the LORD). He is admitting he is outmatched on a physical level, but he is competing on a different level entirely.

- **There is a God in Israel**. David's primary motivation is not his own survival or glory, but God's reputation. He sees this battle as a global testimony to the power of Yahweh.

- **Battle is the LORD's** David understood that he was just a vessel. The outcome did not depend on his strength or skill with a sling, but on God's power and sovereignty. Victory belonged to the Lord.

*Confidence isn’t self-assertion; it’s obedience that trusts God with the outcome*.

### Source of Victory

> David's goal was that *the whole world will know*. How does having a God-centered motive (His glory) change the way we approach our battles?

#### Common Answers

**Acting on His Authority**. To act *in the name of the LORD* means to act as His representative, on His authority, and according to His will. It's a declaration that we are not acting on our own, but as agents of the King.

**Accessing His Power**. It is an expression of dependence. We are admitting our inadequacy and relying completely on His power to accomplish the task.

**Shifting the Focus**. When our goal is God's glory, not our own comfort or success, it frees us from the pressure to perform. It makes us bold, because the outcome is about Him, not us. It turns our problems into a *platform for God to display His power*.

### Reflection (Heart)

> How can you surrender your *battle* to the Lord? How can you acknowledge that the outcome is in His hands and that your role is to be a faithful participant?

## Closing

### Decision (Will)

**Warrior's Declaration**. Are you ready to confront your giant, not with your own strength, but *in the name of the LORD of Hosts*?

**Ultimate Motive**. Is your desire to win your battle for your own relief, or so that others will know *that there is a God in Israel*?

### Challenges (Practice)

**Resume of Faith**. Start a *Faith Journal* this week. Write down one thing God has done for you—a past victory, a recent provision, a moment of grace. Create a written record of your history with God.

**Re-frame Your Battle**. Consider your biggest current challenge and think of a truth from God's word that contradicts it. Begin to see the challenge not as a threat to your ability, but as an opportunity for God's power to be shown.

**Speak the Name**. The next time you feel fear or anxiety about your *giant* this week, stop and say aloud, *The battle is the Lord's, and I come against this in the name of the Lord of Hosts*. Verbalize your confidence, even if your feelings haven't caught up yet.

**Memory Verse**. Memorize [1 Samuel 17:47](https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-47.htm) — "And all those assembled here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD’s, and He will give all of you into our hands.”

### Prayer

> Lord of Hosts, we come before you today and confess that we have been intimidated by the giants in our land. We have listened to their taunts and, like the army of Israel, we have been paralyzed by fear. Forgive us for forgetting Your power and Your past faithfulness.
>
> Father, help us to build a confident faith like David's. Help us to remember the *lions and bears* You have already defeated in our lives. Give us the courage to stand up and testify that the God who delivered us then will deliver us now. Let our confidence not be in our own strength or weapons, but only in Your great name.
>
> We declare today that our battles are Yours. We place them in Your hands. Use our struggles for Your glory, so that the world will know that there is a God in Israel, who saves not by sword or spear, but by His mighty power. We pray all this in the name of the one true victor, Jesus Christ. Amen.
