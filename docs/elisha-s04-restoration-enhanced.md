!!! quote "2 Kings 5, BSB"
    **1** Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in his master's sight and highly regarded, for through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. And he was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.
    **2** At this time the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken a young girl from the land of Israel, and she was serving Naaman’s wife.
    **3** She said to her mistress, “If only my master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would cure him of his leprosy.”
    **4** And Naaman went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said.
    **5** “Go now,” said the king of Aram, “and I will send you with a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of clothing.
    **6** And the letter that he took to the king of Israel stated: “With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman, so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”
    **7** When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and asked, “Am I God, killing and giving life, that this man expects me to cure a leper? Surely you can see that he is seeking a quarrel with me!”
    **8** Now when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king: “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let the man come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.”
    **9** So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha's house.
    **10** Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.”
    **11** But Naaman went away angry, saying, “I thought that he would surely come out, stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the spot to cure my leprosy.
    **12** Are not the Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not have washed in them and been cleansed?” So he turned and went away in a rage.
    **13** Naaman's servants, however, approached him and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, ‘Wash and be cleansed’?”
    **14** So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored and became like that of a little child, and he was clean.
    **15** Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God, stood before him, and declared, “Now I know for sure that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.”
    **16** But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it.” And although Naaman urged him to accept it, he refused.
    **17** “If you will not,” said Naaman, “please let me, your servant, be given as much soil as a pair of mules can carry. For your servant will never again make a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any other god but the LORD.
    **18** Yet may the LORD forgive your servant this one thing: When my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my arm, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant in this matter.”
    **19** “Go in peace,” said Elisha. But after Naaman had traveled a short distance,
    **20** Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Look, my master has spared this Aramean, Naaman, while not accepting what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.”
    **21** So Gehazi pursued Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and asked, “Is everything all right?”
    **22** “Everything is all right,” Gehazi answered. “My master sent me to say, ‘Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.’”
    **23** But Naaman insisted, “Please, take two talents.” He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi.
    **24** When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the gifts from their hands and stored them in the house. Then he sent the men away, and they left.
    **25** When Gehazi went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” “Your servant went nowhere,” he replied.
    **26** But Elisha said to him, “Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to accept money and clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and cattle, or male and female servants?
    **27** Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and to your descendants forever.” So Gehazi went out from Elisha’s presence, as white as snow with leprosy.

# God's Hand in Restoring Lives
**2 Kings 5:1-3, 10-12, 14-17 (with Gehazi warning from 20-27)**

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

**Option A**. When have you misjudged a book by its cover, either a person or a situation?
 
**Option B**. Who’s the most prideful character you recall from a book or movie? What was their downfall or turning point?
 
*Sometimes, the most profound changes come from the most unexpected places*. 

### Core Message

Naaman's healing is a powerful demonstration of God's sovereignty and grace. The CENTRAL TRUTH is:

**God restores us as we are obedient to Him, and His methods often defy our expectations and humble our pride**.

### Lesson Flow

Naaman's journey from disease to restoration unfolds in four movements:

1. **Unlikely Hope**. A servant girl points the way
2. **Test of Pride**. God's method offends Naaman's expectations  
3. **Humble Restoration**. Obedience leads to transformation
4. **Sobering Warning**. Gehazi's cautionary tale

Each scene reveals something about how God works and what He requires of us.

## 1. Unlikely Hope (2 Kings 5:1-3)
**Hope arrives from the most unexpected source.**

!!! quote "2 Kings 5:1-3, BSB"

    **1** Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in his master’s sight and highly regarded, for through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. And he was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.

    **2** At this time the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken a young girl from the land of Israel, and she was serving Naaman’s wife.

    **3** She said to her mistress, “If only my master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would cure him of his leprosy.”

### Context & Insights

Naaman was a man who had it all: power, prestige, and the king's favor. He was a *great man* and a *valiant warrior*. The text even notes that the LORD had given Aram victory through him, a subtle reminder of God's sovereignty over all nations. 
 
Yet, despite his greatness, he had a secret weakness: a *skin disease*. This wasn't necessarily the modern Hansen's disease, but a condition that made him ritually unclean and was often seen as a divine judgment.

The hope for his healing comes not from a king or a great warrior, but from a nameless, young Israelite girl who had been captured in a raid and was now a servant in his house. She was, by all worldly standards, *powerless*. Yet, she held the key to Naaman's restoration.

### Unlikely Messenger

This story immediately shows us that God uses unlikely people for His purposes. He works through the *small*, the *lowly*, and the *weak* to accomplish His great plans. This young girl, in a foreign land and a position of servitude, still had faith in the God of Israel and His prophet. She didn't let her circumstances silence her witness. This is a powerful reminder that God can use *anyone*, *anywhere*, *at any time*.

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    When have you seen God work through an unlikely person or in an unexpected way?

**Servant Girl Principle**
God often places us in hard places so that we can be His witness there.  
The question is never *Why am I here?* but **Who am I here for?**

Consider:  
- a difficult coworker who needs to hear about Christ  
- a challenging family member God has positioned you to influence  
- a painful season that's actually your platform for testimony  

**Reflection**. Who is the *Naaman* in your life—someone with power, success, or status who desperately needs what you have in Christ, but would never think to ask you?

## 2. Test of Pride (2 Kings 5:10-13)
**Naaman's expectations clash with God's simple command.**

!!! quote "2 Kings 5:10-12, BSB"  

    **10** Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.”

    **11** But Naaman went away angry, saying, “I thought that he would surely come out, stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the spot to cure my leprosy.

    **12** Are not the Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.

### Context
Naaman arrived at Elisha's house with his horses and chariots, a full display of his power and importance. He had a clear expectation of how this would go. He, a great man, expected a great show. Instead, Elisha didn't even come out. He sent a messenger with a simple, almost insulting, command: "Go wash seven times in the Jordan." Naaman's pride was wounded. He almost missed his miracle because it didn't fit his script.

### Servants Speak Again (v. 13)

!!! quote "2 Kings 5:13, BSB"  

    But Naaman's servants approached him and said, "My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, 'Wash and be cleansed'?"

*This section provides different approaches to teaching this point*.

!!! question "Discussion Question"  

    Why do you think successful or self-reliant people often struggle to seek or accept help for their deepest needs?

### Common Answers
 
**Pride**.
*Follow-up*. What specifically about success feeds pride? Is it the success itself, or how others view us because of it?
*Go deeper*. Naaman was willing to ask the king of Israel for help, but almost refused to obey Elisha. Why is it sometimes easier to ask powerful people for help than to follow simple instructions?
 
**Used to being in control**.
*Follow-up*. How does asking for help feel like losing control? What are we really afraid of losing?
*Go deeper*. Naaman brought silver, gold, and fine clothing—trying to control the transaction. When do we try to 'buy' our way out of needing grace?
 
**Fear of judgment/loss of reputation**.
*Follow-up*. Naaman tried to hide his leprosy with his achievements. What do we try to hide behind our successes, activities, or image?
*Go deeper*. The servant girl and Naaman's own servants knew about his leprosy. Who in your life already knows your struggle? Why is admitting it publicly so much harder?

!!! question "Discussion Question"  

    What's harder: doing something great for God, or simple daily obedience?

**Appeal of GREAT THINGS vs. Reality of SIMPLE OBEDIENCE**
 
| GREAT THINGS                  | SIMPLE OBEDIENCE              |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Finite – clear beginning & end| Infinite – daily, ongoing     |
| Visible – others applaud      | Invisible – often unnoticed   |
| Controllable – we set terms   | Surrendered – God sets terms  |
| Validates ego                 | Requires daily death to self  |

**Biblical Pattern**.

God repeatedly chooses “foolish” methods to humble pride:  

- Noah’s ark  
- Gideon’s 300  
- David’s sling  
- Jesus’ cross 
- Paul’s weakness  
 
**Quotable**. Eugene Peterson.  

*A long obedience in the same direction is more transformative than short bursts of spectacular commitment.*

## 3. Humble Restoration (2 Kings 5:14-17)
**Humility and obedience lead to complete restoration of body and soul.**

!!! quote "2 Kings 5:14-17, BSB"  

    **14** So Naaman went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God. And his flesh was restored like that of a young boy, and he was clean.

    **15** Then Naaman and all his attendants returned to the man of God. He went and stood before Elisha and said, “Indeed, now I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant.”

    **16** But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will accept nothing.” And though Naaman urged him, Elisha refused.

    **17** “If you will not,” said Naaman, “please let me, your servant, be given as much soil as a pair of mules can carry. For your servant will never again make a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any other god but the LORD.

### Seventh Dip

**Consider Naaman's journey down into the Jordan**.
- **Dip 1**. Pride is screaming. *This is ridiculous. I'm a commander!*
- **Dip 2**. Nothing changes. *I knew this wouldn't work.*
- **Dip 3**. Still diseased. Those servants talked me into this foolishness.
- **Dip 4**. No improvement. The rivers of Damascus are definitely better.
- **Dip 5**. Still leprous. How much longer do I humiliate myself?
- **Dip 6**. No visible change. One more time, then I'm done with this nonsense.
- **Dip 7**. **Complete restoration.** His flesh was restored like that of a young boy.

**Why Seven?**

In Scripture, seven represents completeness and perfection. God could have healed Naaman on the first dip, but the sevenfold command required:

- **Complete obedience** (not partial)
- **Persistent faith** (not giving up at dip 3)
- **Total surrender** (trusting God's process, not demanding results on your timeline)

### Transformation. Deeper Miracle
The most profound restoration was not physical, but spiritual. Naaman returned to Elisha a changed man. He confessed his faith, offered a gift (which was refused, showing grace is free), and committed to exclusive worship. God didn't just heal his skin; He captured his heart.

!!! question "Discussion Question"  

    The text says Naaman’s flesh was restored *like that of a young boy*. Spiritual restoration isn't just fixing a problem; it's a total reset. 
    
    What specific area of your life needs a RESET to childlike faith rather than just a REPAIR?

**SOIL REQUEST**. Naaman's request for two mule-loads of soil seems strange, but it reveals his complete transformation. In that time, gods were thought to be tied to specific lands. Naaman wanted to worship Israel's God on Israel's soil, even back home.

**Modern Equivalent**. What is your *two mules of soil*—the tangible, visible commitment you need to make that shows your restoration is real? Examples:

- Getting rid of something that represents your old life
- Publicly declaring your faith (baptism)
- Cutting off a relationship that pulls you away from Christ
- Starting a discipline you've been avoiding

## 4. Sobering Warning (2 Kings 5:20-27)
**Proximity to miracles does not guarantee a pure heart.**

!!! quote "2 Kings 5:20, 25-26, BSB"  

    **20** But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, “My master has spared this Aramean, Naaman, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him.” ... 
    **25** When he went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?” “Your servant has been nowhere,” he answered. 
    **26** But Elisha said to him, “Did not my spirit go with you...? Is this the time to accept money...?”

**Layers of Deception**.

- Lied to Naaman (invented story about prophets)  
- Lied in God’s name  
- Took double what he originally wanted  
- Hid the loot  
- Lied again to Elisha

**Progression**. Notice how one sin leads to another. Greed → deception → using God's name falsely → theft → cover-up → more lies. 


### Tragic Contrast

Naaman, the pagan outsider, leaves clean and worshiping the true God.  
Gehazi, the spiritual insider, leaves leprous forever.

!!! question "Discussion Question"  

    How does Gehazi's story warn us about wrong motivations even in religious settings?

**Gehazi Syndrome Today**. 

- Using ministry for personal gain or platform  
- Entitlement from years of service (“I deserve…”)  
- Transactional view of grace (“Someone should pay”)  
- Different public faith vs. private life

**What Was Lost vs. Gained**.

| Pursued                     | Lost                                      |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 2 talents silver, 2 outfits| Health, position, integrity, future (leprosy to descendants) |

### New Testament Echoes

Gehazi's story is a warning repeated throughout Scripture:
- **Judas Iscariot** ([John 12:4-6](https://biblehub.com/john/12-4.htm)): Close to Jesus, witnessed miracles, but stole money and ultimately betrayed Him.
- **Ananias and Sapphira** ([Acts 5:1-11](https://biblehub.com/acts/5-1.htm)): Part of the early church, but lied about a financial gift to look generous while being greedy.

The warning is clear: being in the inner circle doesn't make you immune to sin—it increases your accountability.

### Weekly Challenges

1. **Jordan River Step** – Identify one area where God is calling you to simple, humble obedience that your pride resists. Take a concrete step this week.  
2. **Obedience Audit** – Prayerfully work through the checklist (see original notes).  
3. **Unlikely Messenger Watch & Respond** – Look for wisdom from unexpected sources; act on at least one.  
4. **Gehazi Heart Check** – Ask the brutal-honesty questions; confess anything the Spirit reveals.

## Supplementary Content

### Historical & Cultural Context

**Leprosy in the Ancient World**. A catch-all term for skin conditions that made a person ritually unclean and socially isolated. Often seen as divine judgment with no cure.
**The Jordan River**. Muddy and unimpressive compared to Syrian rivers, but symbolically significant as the entry point to the Promised Land.
**Aram (Syria)**. A frequent and powerful enemy of Israel, making Naaman's submission to an Israelite prophet politically and personally humiliating.
**Two Talents of Silver**. Approximately 150 pounds of silver, an enormous sum showing Gehazi's greed.

### Theological Connections
- **God's Sovereignty**. God is Lord over all nations, using even enemy commanders for His purposes.
- **Humility before Grace**. Illustrates the principle that "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble" ([James 4:6](https://biblehub.com/james/4-6.htm)).
- **Salvation by Grace, Not Works**. Elisha's refusal of payment shows that God's healing cannot be earned or purchased.
- **Washing and Rebirth**. Naaman's physical washing is a powerful picture of spiritual rebirth, pointing to **Titus 3:5**, "he saved us...through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit."

## Closing Reflection & Decision

### Closing Reflection
> God always responds positively to our obedience. Humble obedience sets the stage for God to do His greatest work: restoration. Naaman came seeking a cure for his skin, but he left with a new heart. He came as a proud warrior, but he left as a humble worshiper of the one true God. Gehazi, who was closest to the power, completely missed the point.

### Moment of Decision  

Right now, you are one of three characters:
 
**A. Naaman at the riverbank**. You know what God is asking. It feels beneath you or too simple. Healing is on the other side of the seventh dip.  
**B. Servant with a message**. Someone “above” you needs the hope you carry. Will you speak?  
**C. Gehazi in the wings**. Close to God’s work but hiding greed or resentment. Repent before the leprosy sticks.

## Closing Prayer

> Forgive us for the times we, like Naaman, have demanded You work on our terms.  
> Forgive us for the times we, like Gehazi, have been near Your power yet harbored greed.  
> Thank You for free grace that cannot be bought.  
> Give us humility to “go and wash,” to obey in the small daily things, and to trust Your process until the seventh dip.  
> Heal us, cleanse us, make us new—not by our works, but by Your mercy.  
> In Jesus’ name, Amen.
