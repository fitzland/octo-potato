# John the Baptist. Faith that Challenges Others

[Matthew 3:1-17](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/3.htm), BSB

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

**A**. When have you realized you were going completely the wrong way and had to make a drastic U-turn to get back on track? What made you realize your error?

*Sometimes, preparing for what's next means a radical re-evaluation of where we are now.*

### Core Message

Faith to challenge others is the risk of speaking uncomfortable truth to a broken world, while standing in our own unworthiness before the only One who can save.

### Lesson Flow

1. [**Wilderness: Stripping the Mask**](#1-wilderness-stripping-the-mask) (Matt 3:1-10)
2. [**Herald: Authority Through Humility**](#2-herald-authority-through-humility) (Matt 3:11-14)
3. [**Mud: Jesus Enters Our Mess**](#3-mud-jesus-enters-our-mess) (Matt 3:13-17)

## 1. Wilderness: Stripping the Mask (Risk of Social Rejection)

John's radical call to repentance exposes the deadly danger of religious masks—pretending to be righteous while harboring poisonous pride.

### Matthew 3:1-10, BSB

> **1** In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea **2** and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." **3** This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah:
>
> "A voice of one crying out in the wilderness,
> 'Prepare the way for the Lord,
> make straight paths for Him.'"
>
> **4** John's clothes were made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
>
> **5** People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan. **6** Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
>
> **7** But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? **8** Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. **9** And do not think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. **10** The axe is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."

### Context & Insights

- **Wilderness as Unmasking**. John emerges from the wilderness, a wild and untamed place that mirrors the untamed nature of his message. The wilderness was the last place the religious elite wanted to go—no synagogue, no robes, no status markers. To receive John's baptism meant confessing openly that your heritage and position couldn't save you. The wilderness strips away all religious decoration and reveals what's underneath. John's ascetic lifestyle—camel's hair clothing, leather belt, locusts and wild honey—echoed the prophet Elijah (**2 Kings 1:8**), signaling a prophetic ministry that fulfills Isaiah's ancient prophecy (**Isaiah 40:3**). His complete separation from worldly comforts reinforced the urgency and seriousness of his call.

- **Repent**. The Greek word *metanoeō* means *to change one's mind*, signifying a fundamental reorientation of one's entire being—turning away from sin and self, and turning toward God. This isn't just feeling sorry; it's a radical call for a complete change of mind and direction in life—a *U-turn*. John's message is simple yet profound: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near."

- **Kingdom of Heaven**. Used uniquely by Matthew instead of *kingdom of God*, this phrase refers to God's active reign and rule, which is breaking into the present reality through Jesus Christ. The nearness demands an immediate, decisive response—not procrastination or casual consideration.

- **Brood of Vipers**. By calling the Pharisees and Sadducees a *brood of vipers*, John isn't merely insulting them; he's being diagnostic. Vipers were associated with danger and deception, often unseen until they struck. John exposes the deadly spiritual condition beneath their religious respectability: poisonous pride masked by heritage and outward obedience. Their reliance on lineage ("We have Abraham as our father," v. 9) had become a substitute for repentance. John’s warning is urgent and loving. To leave the mask in place would be more dangerous than provoking offense. True love risks confrontation because it refuses to let self-deception go unchallenged. You cannot prepare the way for the Light while pretending you are not in the dark.

- **Produce Fruit**. John saw past outward religiosity to the lack of genuine inner transformation. He demands evidence: actions, attitudes, and words that demonstrate real repentance. God is sovereign and can raise up children for Abraham from literal stones if He chooses (v. 9), foreshadowing the inclusion of Gentiles into God's family through faith. Coming judgment is severe and imminent for those who fail to produce good fruit.

### Wilderness Confrontation

> John took a great risk by publicly confronting the most powerful religious leaders in the wilderness. Why is it often difficult to challenge the status quo or speak an unpopular truth, especially to those in positions of religious or moral authority?

#### Common Answers

**Fear of Retaliation**. Speaking truth to power often brings backlash—rejection, ridicule, or worse.

**Fear of Hypocrisy**. We worry about being called hypocrites if we challenge others while still struggling ourselves.

**Comfort vs. Conviction**. It's easier to maintain comfortable relationships than risk them by speaking uncomfortable truth.

### Modern Masks

> John challenges the idea that being Abraham's descendant guaranteed salvation. What *Abrahamic lineage* (religious background, church attendance, moral living, family heritage) might we rely on today instead of genuine repentance?

#### Common Answers

**Cultural Christianity**. Believing one is a Christian simply by being born in a *Christian nation* or family.

**Good Works**. Relying on good deeds, moral behavior, or church involvement as a means to earn favor with God.

**Intellectual Assent**. Knowing facts about God or the Bible, but lacking a transformative relationship.

**Comparison Trap**. Relying on the fact that we aren't *as broken* as someone else to avoid our own need for a U-turn. We use the *"at least I'm not a..."* argument as a shield against the Holy Spirit's conviction.

### What Is Fruit? (Optional)

> John says, "Produce fruit in keeping with repentance." What are some specific, tangible *fruits* that demonstrate true repentance in daily life?

#### Common Answers

**Changed Priorities**. Time, money, and energy are reoriented toward God's kingdom and values.

**Restitution and Reconciliation**. Making amends for wrongs, seeking forgiveness, and working to restore broken relationships.

**New Desires**. A hunger for God's Word, prayer, and holiness, and a diminished appetite for sin.

### Reflection (Heart)

**Your Mask**. What *mask* are you wearing that prevents honest confession? What would it cost you to step into the wilderness and take it off?

**Your Fruit**. In what ways have your actions, attitudes, or words demonstrated *fruit in keeping with repentance* this past week? Are there any *religious comforts* you might be relying on instead of an active walk with Christ?

*Transition*. John had the authority to confront because he understood his place. He was not the Light; he was only a voice pointing to the Light.

## 2. Herald: Authority Through Humility (Risk of Misunderstanding)

John models how to challenge others: not from a position of superiority, but from radical humility that points beyond ourselves to the One who is worthy.

### Matthew 3:11-14, BSB

> **11** "I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes One who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. **12** His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will clear His threshing floor, gathering His wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
>
> **13** Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. **14** But John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?"

### Context & Insights

- **Not Worthy**. John clearly understands his preparatory role. He humbly contrasts his water baptism (a symbol of outward repentance) with the more profound, transformative work of the *One who is more powerful*—Jesus Christ. To carry someone's sandals was the lowest task of a household servant. John is saying he's not even qualified for the most menial service to Jesus. We often stay silent about truth because we fear being called hypocrites. John solves this by his posture: he admits his own unworthiness (v. 11) and even his own need for Jesus' baptism (v. 14). You don't have to be perfect to speak the truth; you just have to be honest about your own need.

- **Voice, Not Light**. John is *a voice crying out in the wilderness* (**Isaiah 40:3**), not the Light himself. His entire ministry is designed to point beyond himself. We don't speak as *The Light*, but as a *Voice* pointing to the Light. Authority to challenge others comes from our alignment with Christ, not from our personal track record. God's *Truth-Telling Team* has always been made up of the broken: Moses (a murderer), David (an adulterer), and Peter (a denier). Authority doesn't come from a clean record; it comes from a clear confession.

- **Baptism with Holy Spirit and Fire**. This coming Messiah will perform a two-fold baptism: with the Holy Spirit (signifying regeneration, empowerment, and inclusion into God's family) and with fire (signifying purification for the righteous and decisive judgment for the unrepentant). The winnowing fork is an agricultural tool for separating grain from chaff, portraying Christ's ultimate role as judge, separating those who genuinely belong to Him from those who do not.

- **I Need to Be Baptized by You**. Even in this moment when Jesus arrives, John maintains his posture of humility. He recognizes the absurdity of the sinless One seeking baptism from a sinner. But he's willing to obey when Jesus insists, demonstrating that true humility means submitting to Christ's plan even when it doesn't make sense to us.

### Herald's Paradox

> John was bold enough to call the Pharisees *vipers*, yet humble enough to say he wasn't worthy to carry Jesus' sandals. How can boldness and humility coexist in the same person?

#### Common Answers

**Boldness Toward Sin, Humility Before God**. We can be fierce against evil and false religion because we recognize our own complete dependence on grace.

**Source of Authority**. When our authority comes from God's Word rather than our own righteousness, we can speak truth without arrogance.

**Clarity of Role**. John knew exactly who he was (a voice) and who he wasn't (the Light). This clarity freed him to speak boldly while remaining humble.

### Speaking as Voices

> John says he's not even worthy to carry Jesus' sandals, yet he has the courage to challenge the most powerful religious leaders. How does remembering our role as *voices pointing to the Light* free us to speak truth without arrogance or fear of being called hypocrites?

#### Common Answers

**Removes Pressure to Be Perfect**. We're not claiming to be the standard; we're pointing to Jesus who is.

**Shifts Focus from Us to Him**. The message isn't about our righteousness but about Christ's sufficiency.

**Invites Others to Join Us**. We're not standing above people in judgment; we're standing beside them in the river, all needing the same Savior.

### Reflection (Heart)

**Your Posture**. When you've challenged someone or spoken truth, has it been from a position of superiority or from acknowledged unworthiness? What's the difference in how that lands?

**Your Role**. Are there situations where you've remained silent because you felt unworthy to speak? How might John's example of "voice, not light" give you freedom to point to Jesus despite your own brokenness?

*Transition*. If the herald's humility grants him authority to speak, the King's humility grants us the courage to listen. Jesus doesn't challenge us from the safety of the shore; He steps into our mess.

## 3. Mud: Jesus Enters Our Mess (Risk of Vulnerability)

Jesus, the only one without a mask and without sin, steps into the muddy waters of repentance with the broken, showing us how to challenge from within the struggle, not above it.

### Matthew 3:15-17, BSB

> **15** Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
>
> **16** As soon as Jesus was baptized, He went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on Him. **17** And a voice from heaven said, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

### Context & Insights

- **Into the Mud**. Jesus, the sinless Son of God, submits to a baptism of repentance. He doesn't observe the crowd from the safety of the dry bank; He steps into the mud of the Jordan with the broken. To *fulfill all righteousness* meant the Sinless King got dirty in the place designated for sinners. He stood where we stand, confessing solidarity with humanity's need before pronouncing judgment on humanity's sin. If the King is willing to be in the mud with us, we can afford to take off our masks and be honest about our own need. When we challenge others, we must do the same. We don't look down on the "vipers" from a position of safety; we acknowledge that we are all standing in the same river of need, looking at the same Savior.

- **Fulfill All Righteousness**. This phrase captures Jesus' entire mission. He doesn't come to abolish the law but to fulfill it (**Matthew 5:17**). His baptism inaugurates His public ministry of identification with sinners. The righteous One takes His place among the unrighteous so that the unrighteous can take their place among the righteous. This is the gospel pattern: Jesus enters our condition so we can enter His.

- **Trinity Revealed**. This is a beautiful moment where all three persons of the Trinity are present and active: The Son is baptized, the Spirit descends like a dove, and the Father speaks His approval from heaven. This divine announcement merges two Old Testament passages. The phrase *My Son* alludes to a coronation psalm (**Psalm 2:7**) declaring Jesus as the Messianic King. The phrase *in whom I am well pleased* echoes the Servant in **Isaiah 42:1**. Jesus is the King who will reign by becoming a humble, suffering Servant.

- **Heaven Was Opened**. The heavens, shut since the fall, are torn open. God is speaking again. The Spirit is descending again. This is the beginning of the new creation, the inauguration of the kingdom John proclaimed. The Father's affirmation confirms that Jesus' act of humility—standing in the river with sinners—is exactly what righteousness looks like.

### Challenge from Within

> Jesus didn't challenge humanity from the safety of heaven; He stepped into the Jordan's mud with us. How does this change the way you approach difficult conversations—are you speaking from the shore or from the river?

#### Common Answers

**Empathy vs. Judgment**. Speaking from the river means we understand the struggle; speaking from the shore comes across as condescending.

**Shared Need**. When we acknowledge our own need for the same grace, our challenges carry humility rather than arrogance.

**Incarnational Ministry**. Following Jesus' example means entering people's mess, not shouting at them from a distance.

### What Righteousness Looks Like

> Jesus said His baptism was necessary to *fulfill all righteousness*. What does it reveal about true righteousness that Jesus—sinless and perfect—chose to stand in the river with sinners?

#### Common Answers

**Righteousness Is Relational**. It's not just about personal purity but about solidarity with those who need rescue.

**Humility Is Central**. True righteousness doesn't elevate itself above others but descends to where they are.

**Love Requires Risk**. To truly love and challenge someone means being willing to get dirty alongside them.

### Reflection (Heart)

**Jesus' Example**. Jesus submitted to a baptism of repentance to *fulfill all righteousness*. How does His example challenge your willingness to obey God, even in acts that seem unnecessary or humbling?

**Your River**. Who are the *vipers* in your life—people you're tempted to judge from a distance? What would it look like to step into the river with them instead of challenging them from the shore?

## Closing

### Decision (Will)

**Strip the Mask**. Are you willing to step into the wilderness and remove your religious mask, honestly confessing your need for repentance?

**Embrace the Herald's Role**. Will you pair bold truth with sincere humility in your own life, speaking as a voice that points to the Light rather than claiming to be the Light?

**Enter the Mud**. Are you ready to challenge others not from a position of safety, but from within the shared struggle, acknowledging that we all need the same Savior?

This week, if God gives you an opportunity to speak a hard truth, do not wait to feel *worthy*. Speak as a voice — honestly, humbly, and clearly — pointing to Christ.

### Challenges (Practice)

**Integrity in Action**. To ensure our bold message has integrity, we must live it out. This week, identify one area where your life needs to better align with the truth you believe, and take a concrete step of repentance. Journal about what "fruit" should be visible in your life as evidence of that repentance.

**Faithful Messenger**. Prayerfully identify one person in your life who needs to hear the truth about Jesus. Ask God for the courage and humility to share with them. Before you speak, ask yourself: "Am I speaking from the shore or from the river? Have I acknowledged my own need for grace?"

**Remove the Chaff**. Identify one *chaff* (habit, attitude, distraction) in your life that keeps you from God's priorities. Take a decisive step this week to address it—whether that means confession, accountability, or a practical change in your schedule or habits.

**Memory Verse**. Memorize [Matthew 3:11](https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm) — "I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes One who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire."

### Prayer

> Heavenly Father, we come before You, humbled by the urgent and radical call of John the Baptist. We confess that too often we wear religious masks, relying on heritage, good works, or moral comparison instead of genuine repentance. We confess that we speak truth from positions of superiority rather than humility, challenging others from the shore instead of stepping into the river with them. Forgive us for our complacency and our pride.

> We praise You for sending John to prepare the way, and even more for sending Jesus, the One who baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with fire. Thank You for the example of John's bold humility and for Jesus' humble obedience. Thank You that the Sinless King was willing to stand in the muddy Jordan with sinners, showing us what true righteousness looks like.

> Make us faithful messengers who decrease so that Christ may increase. Give us the courage to strip off our masks in the wilderness and produce fruit worthy of repentance. Grant us the boldness to speak uncomfortable truth, paired with the humility to acknowledge our own unworthiness. Help us to challenge not from a position of safety, but from within the shared struggle, pointing always to the Light.

> Prepare our hearts for Your Son's return, O Lord, and empower us by Your Spirit to live with urgency, authenticity, and joyful expectation of Your kingdom. May our lives be wheat for Your barn, not chaff for the fire. In Jesus' mighty name we pray. Amen.
