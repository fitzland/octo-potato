# Faith Grounded in God's Word
**Joshua 1:1-9, 16-18 (BSB)**

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

**A**. Think about a time you stepped into a new, challenging role (new job, parent, leader). What was the single most helpful piece of advice or instruction you received?

**B**. Who is someone you consider a 'hero of the faith' in your own life? What qualities did they model that you admire?

*Our faith is not built on feelings, but on the firm foundation of God's promises and commands.*

### Core Message

**Faith is grounded in obedience to God’s Word; from that foundation, God gives us the courage to accomplish His will.**

### Lesson Flow

This lesson explores how Joshua's commissioning provides a timeless model for faith, courage, and obedience.

## 1. The Commissioning (Joshua 1:1-4)
[<small>Back to Lesson Flow</small>](#lesson-flow)

**After Moses's death, God calls Joshua to lead Israel into their destiny.**

!!! quote "Joshua 1:1-4, BSB"

    **1** After the death of His servant Moses, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying, **2** “Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore arise, you and all these people, and cross over the Jordan into the land that I am giving to the children of Israel. **3** I have given you every place where the sole of your foot will tread, just as I promised to Moses. **4** Your territory shall extend from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great River Euphrates—all the land of the Hittites—and west as far as the Great Sea.

### Context & Insights

**A Leadership Mantle Passed**. The book opens at a pivotal, uncertain moment: "Moses My servant is dead." The heroic leader who brought Israel out of Egypt and received the Law is gone. God doesn't dwell on the past but immediately pivots to the future with the command: "Now therefore arise." He calls Joshua, Moses's long-time assistant, to step into one of history's most daunting leadership roles.

    Joshua had been Moses's "assistant" for decades. He was on Mount Sinai with Moses (Ex. 24:13), he was one of the twelve spies who gave a faithful report (Num. 14), and he was designated as Moses's successor before the nation (Deut. 31). His preparation was long and thorough. Yet, the divine call here is what truly inaugurates his leadership. It's a reminder that past experience prepares us, but God's specific call empowers us.

**A Promise Reaffirmed**. God immediately grounds His command in a promise. The land of Canaan, first promised to Abraham, is now reaffirmed to Joshua's generation. God states it in the past tense—"I have given you"—even though they have not yet set foot in it. The victory is already secured in God's sovereign decree. Joshua's task is not to *earn* the land but to *claim* it by obediently walking where God has already granted victory.

    What does the statement "Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore arise..." teach us about how God works through human leaders and transitions?

## 2. The Conditions for Success (Joshua 1:5-9)
[<small>Back to Lesson Flow</small>](#lesson-flow)

**God's formula for victory is His presence, our courage, and unwavering obedience to His Word.**

!!! quote "Joshua 1:5-9, BSB"

    **5** No one shall stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you. **6** Be strong and courageous, for you shall give these people the inheritance of the land that I swore to their fathers I would give them. **7** Above all, be strong and very courageous. Be careful to observe all the law that My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may prosper wherever you go. **8** This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. For then you will prosper and succeed in all you do. **9** Have I not commanded you to be strong and courageous? Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”

### Context & Insights

**The Foundation: God's Presence**. The first and most crucial promise is, "As I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you." This is the bedrock of Joshua's (and our) confidence. Success doesn't come from Joshua's strength, but from God's presence. Every other command and promise flows from this one truth.

**The Command: Be Strong and Courageous**. Three times God commands Joshua to be "strong and courageous." This is not a suggestion to feel brave, but a command to act with courage, rooted in the truth of God's presence and promises. Notice the progression:
-   **v. 6**: Be strong and courageous *because you have a mission to complete* (inherit the land).
-   **v. 7**: Be strong and very courageous *so that you can obey God's Word completely*.
-   **v. 9**: Be strong and courageous *because God's presence is with you*.

???+ success "Application. The Source of Courage"

    True spiritual courage isn't the absence of fear; it's the choice to obey God despite fear. It's fueled by trusting in God's unshakeable presence and His unchanging Word, not by our own abilities or circumstances.

**The Method: Meditate on the Word**. The key to prosperity and success is explicitly tied to Joshua's relationship with the "Book of the Law." He is commanded to meditate on it day and night. The Hebrew word for meditate, *hagah*, means to mutter, ponder, and speak to oneself. It implies a constant, absorbing focus on Scripture. This saturation with God's Word is what enables careful obedience, which in turn leads to true success.

## 3. The Commitment of the People (Joshua 1:16-18)
[<small>Back to Lesson Flow</small>](#lesson-flow)

**The nation pledges their total allegiance to Joshua, echoing God's charge.**

!!! quote "Joshua 1:16-18, BSB"

    **16** So they answered Joshua, “Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go. **17** Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. And may the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses. **18** Anyone who rebels against your order and does not obey your words, all that you command him, will be put to death. Above all, be strong and courageous!”

### Context & Insights

**A Unanimous Vow of Obedience**. After receiving God's charge, Joshua relays instructions to the people. Their response is immediate, unified, and absolute. "Everything you have commanded us we will do." They transfer the allegiance they had for Moses directly to Joshua, legitimizing his leadership and demonstrating their readiness to follow.

**Echoing God's Encouragement**. The people's response culminates in a beautiful echo of God's own words to Joshua: "Above all, be strong and courageous!" They not only pledge their followership but also step into the role of encouragers. They minister back to their new leader, strengthening his hands for the task ahead by reinforcing God's command. This shows a healthy, reciprocal relationship between a leader and his people.

??? info "Read More. The Seriousness of Obedience"

    The people's declaration that any rebel would be "put to death" underscores the gravity of their mission. In a military context where unity and discipline were matters of life and death, disobedience could not be tolerated. This reflects the high stakes of their covenantal commitment to God and His appointed leader. They understood that to rebel against Joshua was to rebel against the God who commissioned him.

!!! question "Discussion Question"

    The people not only obeyed Joshua but also encouraged him. How can we, as followers, actively encourage and strengthen the leaders God has placed in our lives (in church, family, or work)?

## Closing

### Reflection
> The transition from Moses to Joshua was a blueprint for spiritual succession and success. God's mission moves forward through people, but it is founded on His unchanging Word and guaranteed by His unfailing presence. Joshua was called to an impossible task, but he was given an unbeatable formula: remain saturated in God's Word, obey it completely, and act with the courage that comes from knowing God is with you. As a result, a whole nation was inspired to follow and commit to the cause.

### Decision

Where does this passage challenge you today?

**A. In a Moment of Transition**. Are you facing a "Moses is dead" moment? Grieve the past, but hear God's call to "arise" and move into the future He has for you, trusting His presence will go with you.

**B. Facing a Daunting "Canaan"**. What impossible task is God calling you to? Shift your focus from the size of the challenge to the size of your God and the certainty of His Word.

**C. Lacking Courage**. Has fear or discouragement held you back? Recognize that courage is a command to be obeyed, not a feeling to be waited for. Take one "strong and courageous" step of faith this week.

**D. Spiritually Dry**. Is your engagement with God's Word sporadic or shallow? Commit to the discipline of meditation—making the "Book of the Law" the constant soundtrack of your mind and heart.

## Prayer

> Lord God, thank You for the promise that You will never leave us nor forsake us. Forgive us for the times we have been afraid and discouraged, forgetting the power of Your presence. We ask for the courage of Joshua to step into the challenges You have set before us. May Your Word not depart from our mouths, but may we meditate on it day and night, so that we may be careful to do everything written in it. Make us strong and very courageous, so that we can faithfully accomplish Your will. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

## Weekly Challenges

### 1. Scripture Saturation (Meditation)
Choose one verse from Joshua 1 that speaks to your current situation (e.g., v. 5, v. 9). Write it on a note card or set it as your phone background. Intentionally "meditate" on it—mutter it, ponder it, pray it—every day this week.

### 2. A Single Act of Courage (Action)
Identify one specific, fear-inducing step of obedience God is calling you to (a conversation, a decision, an act of service). This week, take that single step, consciously trusting that God's presence goes with you.

### 3. Encourage Your Leader (Attitude + Action)
Think of a leader in your life (pastor, teacher, parent, boss). Send them a note, text, or email this week with a simple message of support, telling them you are praying for them to be "strong and courageous" in their role.
