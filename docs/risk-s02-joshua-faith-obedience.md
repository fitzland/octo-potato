# Joshua. Faith Grounded in God's Word
[Joshua 1:1-9, 16-18 (BSB)](https://biblehub.com/bsb/joshua/1.htm)

## Introduction

### Icebreaker

**A**. Think about a time you stepped into a new, challenging role (new job, parent, leader). What was the single most helpful piece of advice or instruction you received?

**B**. Who is someone you consider a 'hero of the faith' in your own life? What qualities did they model that you admire?

*Our faith is not built on feelings, but on the firm foundation of God's promises and commands.*

### Core Message

**Faith is grounded in obedience to God’s Word; from that foundation, God gives us the courage to accomplish His will.**

## 1. Commissioning

**After Moses's death, God calls Joshua to lead Israel into their destiny.**

!!! quote "Joshua 1:1-4, BSB"

    **1** After the death of His servant Moses, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying, **2** “Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore arise, you and all these people, and cross over the Jordan into the land that I am giving to the children of Israel. **3** I have given you every place where the sole of your foot will tread, just as I promised to Moses. **4** Your territory shall extend from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great River Euphrates—all the land of the Hittites—and west as far as the Great Sea.

### Context & Insights

The book opens at a pivotal, uncertain moment: "Moses My servant is dead." The heroic leader who brought Israel out of Egypt and received the Law is gone. God doesn't dwell on the past but immediately pivots to the future with the command: "Now therefore arise." He calls Joshua, Moses's long-time assistant, to step into one of history's most daunting leadership roles.

- *Moses My servant is dead*. God states the blunt reality. The past, however glorious, is over. The future cannot begin until this fact is faced.
- *Now therefore arise*. This is a command, not a suggestion. It demands immediate action based on God's authority. God's work does not depend on a single human leader.
- *I have given you*. The victory is stated in the past tense. God doesn't promise He *will* give them the land; He declares it is already theirs. Joshua's job is not to win it, but to possess what has already been won.

**Illustration**. Imagine a legendary founder and CEO of a wildly successful company suddenly passes away. The company is gripped by uncertainty. The next morning, the board doesn't issue a long eulogy but a clear directive to the founder's long-time deputy: "Steve is gone. Now, it's your turn. Rise up. The plans for the next phase of growth have already been approved. Go and execute them." The focus isn't on the loss but on the mission ahead, grounded in the authority of the board's decision.

!!! question "Leadership in Transition"

    1. What does the statement *Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore arise...* teach us about how God accomplishes His plans?

#### Common Answers

**God's Mission is Unstoppable**. It shows that God's plan is never dependent on a single person. He works through individuals, but the mission is His, and it continues even when great leaders fall.

**God Prepares His Leaders**. Joshua had been Moses's assistant for 40 years. God had been preparing him for this moment long before it arrived. It reminds us that seasons of service and "second-in-command" roles are often God's training ground for future leadership.

**Facing Reality is a Prerequisite for Faith**. God starts with the hard truth: *Moses is dead*. We cannot step into the future God has for us until we accept the reality of our present circumstances, even if they are painful.

*Dig Deeper*. Why is it sometimes difficult for us (or for organizations) to move forward after a significant loss or change in leadership? What does this passage teach us about letting go?

### Practical Application

**Embrace Your Commissioning**. Reflect on the role God has you in right now. Acknowledge that He has placed you there for a purpose, even if you feel like you're in the shadow of a *Moses*.

**Claim a *Past Tense* Promise**. Find a promise in Scripture that applies to your life and begin to thank God for it as if it were already accomplished. For example, *I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me* (Phil. 4:13) is a present reality to be claimed, not a future hope to wish for.

*Transition*. The commission is given and the promise is sure, but God doesn't stop there. He provides Joshua with the precise conditions for success.

## 2. Conditions for Success

**God's formula for victory is His presence, our courage, and unwavering obedience to His Word.**

!!! quote "Joshua 1:5-9, BSB"

    **5** No one shall stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you. **6** Be strong and courageous, for you shall give these people the inheritance of the land that I swore to their fathers I would give them. **7** Above all, be strong and very courageous. Be careful to observe all the law that My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may prosper wherever you go. **8** This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. For then you will prosper and succeed in all you do. **9** Have I not commanded you to be strong and courageous? Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”

### Context & Insights

- **Foundation: God's Presence**. The first and most crucial promise is, *As I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you*. This is the bedrock of Joshua's (and our) confidence. Success doesn't come from Joshua's strength, but from God's presence.
- **Command: Be Strong and Courageous**. Three times God commands Joshua to *be strong and courageous*. This is not a suggestion to feel brave, but a command to act with courage, rooted in the truth of God's presence and promises.
- **Method: Meditate on the Word**. The key to success is explicitly tied to Joshua's relationship with the *Book of the Law*. He is commanded to meditate on it day and night. The Hebrew word for meditate, (*hah-GAH*), means to mutter or ponder. This saturation with God's Word enables careful obedience.

**Illustration**. Imagine a championship coach handing the game plan to the team captain. The coach says, "I'll be on the sideline with you the whole game. Don't be scared; just be bold. But your success depends on one thing: you must run the plays exactly as we've drawn them up. Don't improvise. Study the playbook, know it by heart, and execute it. Then you will succeed." God's charge to Joshua is that clear and direct.

!!! question "Formula for Success"

    1. God's formula for success was meditating on His Word so he could obey it. How does this contrast with the world's formulas for success today?
    2. What does it practically mean to "meditate" on God's word *day and night* in the 21st century?

#### Common Answers

**World's vs. God's Formula**. The world's formula relies on self-reliance, clever strategy, networking, and personal charisma. God's formula relies on God-reliance, obedience to His revealed will, and trust in His presence.

**Modern Meditation**. It means constant engagement, not just a morning quiet time. This could look like listening to audio Scripture during a commute, setting phone reminders with verses, discussing the Bible with friends, and consciously bringing God's Word to mind in moments of decision or stress.

*Dig Deeper*. How can worldly values (like networking or self-promotion) sometimes sneak into our approach to ministry or Christian living?

### Practical Application

**Courage Check**. Identify one area where fear or discouragement is holding you back. Find a specific promise from God that applies to that situation and choose to act in *strong and courageous* obedience this week.

**Meditation Method**. Pick one new method to meditate on God's word this week. Try listening to a Psalm on your way to work, writing a verse on a sticky note for your desk, or texting a verse to a friend to discuss.

*Transition*. God has given the commission and the conditions for success. The final piece is the response of the people.

## 3. Commitment of the People

**The nation pledges their total allegiance to Joshua, echoing God's charge.**

!!! quote "Joshua 1:16-18, BSB"

    **16** So they answered Joshua, “Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go. **17** Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. And may the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses. **18** Anyone who rebels against your order and does not obey your words, all that you command him, will be put to death. Above all, be strong and courageous!”

### Context & Insights

- **Unanimous Vow**. After receiving God's charge, Joshua relays instructions to the people. Their response is immediate, unified, and absolute: *Everything you have commanded us we will do*. They transfer the allegiance they had for Moses directly to Joshua, legitimizing his leadership.
- **Echoing Encouragement**. The people's response culminates in a beautiful echo of God's own words to Joshua: *Above all, be strong and courageous!* They not only pledge their followership but also step into the role of encouragers. They minister back to their new leader, strengthening his hands for the task ahead.
- **Seriousness of Obedience**. The declaration that any rebel would be *put to death* underscores the gravity of their mission. In a military context where unity and discipline were matters of life and death, they understood that to rebel against Joshua was to rebel against the God who commissioned him.

**Illustration**. Imagine a new team captain is appointed after a beloved star player retires. The mood is uncertain. Then, one by one, the veteran players approach the new captain. They don't just say, *We'll follow you*. They look him in the eye and say, *The same way we supported the old captain, we will support you. We've got your back. Now, lead with the same boldness he did*. This act of verbal commitment changes the entire dynamic of the team.

!!! question "Followership & Encouragement"

    1. The people not only promised to obey Joshua but also encouraged him by echoing God's command. Why is it important for followers to actively encourage their leaders?
    2. What does a healthy, reciprocal relationship between leaders and followers look like in a church context?

#### Common Answers

**Leadership is Lonely**. Leaders often carry a heavy burden of responsibility and face criticism. Active encouragement from followers provides vital strength, affirmation, and a reminder that they are not alone.

**Shared Ownership**. When followers encourage their leaders, it shows they are invested in the mission, not just passively receiving instructions. It builds a sense of shared purpose and unity.

**Healthy Relationships**. It looks like mutual respect, open communication (leaders sharing vision, followers giving honest feedback), and followers who pray for and publicly support their leaders, rather than undermining them. Leaders, in turn, serve and equip the followers.

*Dig Deeper*. What is the difference between healthy encouragement and unhealthy flattery? How can we ensure our support for leaders is genuine and God-honoring?

### Practical Application

**Encourage a Leader**. Think of a leader in your life (pastor, teacher, small group leader, parent). Send them a specific, encouraging message this week. Instead of a generic *thanks,* tell them you are praying for them to be *strong and courageous* in their specific role.

**Commit to Unity**. Identify one way you can actively contribute to the unity of your church or community. It could be by speaking positively about leadership, refusing to participate in gossip, or volunteering to serve.

## Closing

### Reflection

The transition from Moses to Joshua is a blueprint for spiritual succession and success. God's mission moves forward through people, but it is founded on His unchanging Word and guaranteed by His unfailing presence. Joshua was called to an impossible task, but he was given an unbeatable formula: remain saturated in God's Word, obey it completely, and act with the courage that comes from knowing God is with you. As a result, a whole nation was inspired to follow and commit to the cause.

### Decision

**A**. In a Moment of Transition – Are you facing a *Moses is dead* moment? Grieve the past, but hear God's call to *arise* and move into the future He has for you.
**B**. Facing a Daunting *Canaan* – What impossible task is God calling you to? Shift your focus from the size of the challenge to the size of your God.
**C**. Lacking Courage – Has fear held you back? Recognize that courage is a command to be obeyed, not a feeling to be waited for. Take one *strong and courageous* step of faith.
**D**. Spiritually Dry – Is your engagement with God's Word shallow? Commit to the discipline of daily meditation.

### Challenges

#### 1. Scripture Saturation.
Choose one verse from Joshua 1 that speaks to your current situation (e.g., v. 5, v. 9). Write it on a note card or set it as your phone background. *meditate* on it—mutter it, ponder it, pray it—every day this week.

#### 2. Single Act of Courage.
Identify one specific, fear-inducing step of obedience God is calling you to (a difficult conversation, a financial decision, an act of service). This week, take that single step, consciously trusting that God's presence goes with you.

#### 3. Encourage Your Leader.
Think of a leader in your life (pastor, teacher, parent). Send them a note, text, or email this week with a simple message of support, telling them you are praying for them to be *strong and courageous* in their role.

#### 4. One-Verse Memory.
Memorize [Joshua 1:9](https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-9.htm) this week*Have I not commanded you to be strong and courageous? Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go*.

### Prayer

> Lord God, thank You for the promise that You will never leave us nor forsake us. Forgive us for the times we have been afraid and discouraged, forgetting the power of Your presence. We ask for the courage of Joshua to step into the challenges You have set before us. May Your Word not depart from our mouths, but may we meditate on it day and night, so that we may be careful to do everything written in it. Make us strong and very courageous, so that we can faithfully accomplish Your will. In Jesus’ name, Amen.
