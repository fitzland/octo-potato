# How does the righteousness that Jesus requires differ from that of the Pharisees?

The righteousness Jesus requires differs *fundamentally* from the righteousness practiced by the Pharisees, primarily in its *source*, *focus*, *motivation*, *scope*, and *result*.

1.  **Source:**
    *   **Pharisaic Righteousness:** Primarily **human-achieved** and **self-generated**. They believed they could attain righteousness through meticulous obedience to the Law (as they interpreted it, including their traditions). It was based on their *performance*.
    *   **Jesus' Required Righteousness:** Ultimately **God-given** and **imputed**. While it results in righteous actions, its foundation is the perfect righteousness of Christ credited to the believer through faith (Romans 3:21-22; Philippians 3:9). It originates *outside* of oneself.

2.  **Focus:**
    *   **Pharisaic Righteousness:** Heavily focused on **external** actions, rituals, and adherence to the letter of the Law and human traditions. They were concerned with outward appearances (Matthew 23:5, 25-28 - cleaning the outside of the cup, whitewashed tombs).
    *   **Jesus' Required Righteousness:** Focuses on the **internal** – the heart, motives, attitudes, and desires. Jesus digs beneath the surface action to the root intent (Matthew 5:21-22 - anger is like murder; Matthew 5:27-28 - lust is like adultery). It's about inward transformation leading to outward obedience.

3.  **Motivation:**
    *   **Pharisaic Righteousness:** Often motivated by **self-glorification**, seeking praise from others, maintaining status, and earning merit before God (Matthew 6:1-5; Luke 18:11-12 - the Pharisee boasting in prayer). Fear of punishment or desire for reward based on performance could also be factors.
    *   **Jesus' Required Righteousness:** Motivated by **love for God** and **love for neighbor** (Matthew 22:37-40), flowing from gratitude for God's grace and a transformed heart. It seeks to please God rather than impress people (Matthew 6 - doing righteous acts in secret).

4.  **Scope:**
    *   **Pharisaic Righteousness:** Often limited to the **letter of the Law**, sometimes even finding loopholes (like the Corban rule, Mark 7:9-13) to avoid the Law's deeper intent. They added burdensome traditions.
    *   **Jesus' Required Righteousness:** Encompasses the **spirit and full intent** of the Law. Jesus reveals the deeper meaning and radical demands behind the commands, showing they reach into our thoughts and desires. It fulfills the Law's ultimate purpose.

5.  **Result:**
    *   **Pharisaic Righteousness:** Led to **hypocrisy** (saying one thing, doing another, or having impure motives behind pure actions), **pride**, **judgmentalism**, and ultimately fell short of God's perfect standard.
    *   **Jesus' Required Righteousness:** Leads to **genuine transformation**, **humility** (recognizing one's dependence on God's grace), **sincerity**, and actions that truly reflect God's character, empowered by the Holy Spirit.

**In essence:**

The Pharisees tried to build righteousness from the outside in, through human effort and external conformity. Jesus requires righteousness that works from the inside out, originating from God's grace through faith in Him, transforming the heart and resulting in authentic obedience motivated by love. That's why it must *surpass* the Pharisees' – it's not just quantitatively *more* rule-keeping, but qualitatively *different* and infinitely higher because its source and nature are divine.
