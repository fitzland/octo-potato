### Review (Jesus & the Law)

Jesus did not come to **ABOLISH** the Law, but rather to **FULFILL** the Law.

!!! question "Icebreaker"   
    
    What's the difference between being angry and expressing anger? Is one more acceptable than the other?
    
    When you were really angry with someone but managed to hold back from saying or doing something hurtful. What helped you control your anger in that moment, and how did you feel afterward?

### Passage

!!! quote "Matthew 5:21-26"

    21 You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'Do not murder' and 'Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' 
    
    22 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be subject to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be subject to the fire of hell.
    
    23 So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, 24 leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
    
    25 Reconcile quickly with your adversary, while you are still on the way to court. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

### Context

Jesus has stated that He did not come to abolish the Law but to fulfill it, and that our righteousness must exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees (5:17-20). Now, Jesus provides the first of six **antitheses** where He contrasts the traditional understanding ("*You have heard it said...*") with His more complete interpretation ("*But I say to you...*").

## The Sixth Commandment

> [`Matthew 5:21`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-21.htm). You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'Do not murder' and 'Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.'

### What is the traditional understanding?

**Decalogue**. Jesus references specifically the Decalogue (or 10 Commandments) and more generally all the judicial guidelines related to the sixth command in the Law. 

When we typically hear the sixth commandment, it goes like this: *Thou shall not kill*, but the Hebrew term is more specific and refers to unlawful, intentional killing with malice.

> [`Exodus 20:13`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-13.htm). Do not murder. Also [`Deuteronomy 5:17`](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-17.htm).

!!! info "Murder"   
    (Heb. ratsach). murder, slay with premeditation and evil intent.

### What are other forms of killing?

**Manslaughter**. Killing someone *unintentionally*, without prior hatred or planning. Intent is a critical factor when determining if the killing is considered murder.

> [`Numbers 35:12`](https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm). You are to have cities as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer will not die until he stands trial before the assembly.

**Capital punishment**. The Law prescribed the *death penalty* for certain offenses, including premeditated murder, kidnapping, adultery, and blasphemy. These state-sanctioned executions, carried out after due process (requiring witnesses, judgment) were not considered murder.

> [`Exodus 21:12`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm). Whoever strikes and kills a man must surely be put to death.

> [`Exodus 21:16`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-16.htm). Whoever kidnaps another man must be put to death, whether he sells him or the man is found in his possession. 

**Warfare**. Wars commanded or permitted by God (*national defense*) involved killing but were generally understood within a different framework than personal, unlawful murder.

> [`Deuteronomy 7:1-2`](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7.htm). When the Lord your God brings you into the land…, then you must destroy them totally. (conquest of Canaan)

> [`1 Samuel 15:1-3`](https://biblehub.com/1samuel/15.htm). Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. (during monarchy)

**Self-defense**. Killing a *thief* breaking into one's house at night. 

> [`Exodus 22:2`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-2.htm). If a thief is caught breaking in and is beaten to death, no one shall be guilty of bloodshed.

### Why is murder prohibited?

**Value of Human Life**. Human life is sacred because people are created in the _image of God_ (Genesis 1:27).

**Attack on God**. Taking a human life is not just an assault on the individual but on the God in whose image they are made.

### What are the consequences of murder?

> [`Genesis 9:6`](https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm). Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed.

**Established Principle**. This verse, given after the Flood long before the Mosaic Law, establishes the principle: taking a life made in God's image demands the forfeiture of the killer's life as a just consequence.

**Capital Punishment**. The penalty for proven murder was death. There was no possibility of substitution or paying a ransom (Numbers 35:31). The principle of *lex talionis* ("life for life" - Exodus 21:23-24) applied directly here.

**Bloodguilt**. Unavenged murder was believed to pollute the land where the community lived (Numbers 35:33-34). The land could only be cleansed by the blood (execution) of the one who shed innocent blood.

## A New Interpretation

> [`Matthew 5:22`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm). But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be subject to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be subject to the fire of hell.

### But I tell you...
    
Jesus claims authority equal to or greater than the traditional interpretation of the Law. He shifts the focus from the *outward act* of murder to the *internal attitude* that precedes it.

### What is the root of murder?

> [`Genesis 4:5-8`](https://biblehub.com/genesis/4.htm). Cain's anger preceded his murder of Abel.

> [`1 John 3:15`](https://biblehub.com/1john/3-15.htm). Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer.

**Anger**. The same root of *malice* and *disregard* for the value of another human being that leads to **physical murder** is present in _unrighteous anger_, _contemptuous speech_ (Raca), and *condemning judgment* (You fool!). 

While the Old Testament Law primarily dealt with the _external act_, Jesus revealed that God judges the _internal attitude_ with equal seriousness. He connects these heart issues to judgment, even the _fire of hell_. He wasn't lessening the gravity of physical murder; He was elevating the gravity of the internal sins that are its root.

Being angry with a brother _without cause_ or with simmering _resentment_ makes one subject to judgment.

> [`Ephesians 4:26-27`](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4.htm). Be angry, yet do not sin.

> [`James 1:19-20`](https://biblehub.com/james/1.htm). Man's anger does not bring about the righteousness that God desires.

### How does anger escalate?

Jesus describes how internal anger manifests verbally with increasing severity:

| Expression | Meaning | Consequence |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Anger** | Internal hostility | Subject to judgment |
| **Raca** | Showing contempt for intellect/worth | Subject to the Sanhedrin (highest Jewish court) |
| **You fool!** | Implying moral and spiritual deficiency (Psalm 14:1) | Subject to the fire of hell (Gehenna) |

> [`Proverbs 12:18`](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-18.htm). The words of the reckless pierce like swords.

> [`Matthew 12:36-37`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/12.htm#36). Men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word.

> [`James 3:6-10`](https://biblehub.com/james/3.htm#6). The destructive power of the tongue.

!!! info "Raca"   
    (Grk. rhaka). from an Aramaic term meaning empty-headed, worthless.
    
    An expression of profound *contempt* and *dismissal*. It attacks a person's intelligence and inherent worth, essentially saying, "You are nothing; your opinion/existence doesn't matter.

!!! info "Sanhedrin"   
    The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish judicial council in Jerusalem, composed of 71 members (elders, chief priests, scribes). It dealt with the most serious religious and legal matters.
    
    Jesus isn't necessarily saying that the Sanhedrin would literally prosecute someone for using this term. Rather, He's using the highest human court as a *benchmark for the seriousness* of the offense in God's eyes.

> [`Psalm 14:1`](https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm). The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'

!!! info "You Fool!"   
    (Gr. mōros). dull, stupid; to imply moral and spiritual deficiency, godlessness. 
    
    This word from which we get the word _moron_ carries a heavier weight than just intellectual deficiency. It implies *moral and spiritual* deficiency. 

**Fire of Hell**. Jesus indicates that this kind of condemnatory speech reflects a heart condition that is so severely opposed to God's love and judgment that it aligns the speaker with those deserving eternal punishment. 

**My Judgment**. When we label someone as a moral and spiritual reprobate, we usurp God's role as judge and express a level of malice and condemnation that originates from a heart condition worthy of hell itself.

## At the Altar

> [`Matthew 5:23-24`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5.htm#21) So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.

### What is the significance?

**Act of Worship**. The Temple in Jerusalem, and specifically its altar(s), was the designated center of Israel's worship life according to the Mosaic Covenant. Bringing offerings was not optional for a devout Jew; it was a commanded means of relating to God.

#### Types of Offerings

The _gift_ (Greek: *dōron*) could refer to various types of offerings (Leviticus 1-7):

**Sacrifices for Atonement**. Sin Offerings (*chattat*) and Guilt Offerings (*asham*) were crucial for dealing with unintentional sins and specific trespasses, restoring the individual's relationship with God and the community after wrongdoing.

**Fellowship & Thanksgiving**. Peace Offerings (*shelamim*), which included thanksgiving offerings, vow offerings, and freewill offerings, often involved a shared meal, signifying communion and peace with God.

**Dedication & Homage**. Burnt Offerings (*olah*) signified complete surrender and dedication to God. Grain Offerings (*minchah*) represented the dedication of one's labor and substance.

**Other Gifts**. Tithes and firstfruits were also sometimes brought to the Temple complex.

#### Purpose & Meaning

Offerings served multiple purposes:

**Obedience**. Fulfilling God's commands in the Law.

**Atonement**. Seeking forgiveness and cleansing from sin.

**Worship**. Expressing reverence, adoration, and homage to God.

**Thanksgiving**. Showing gratitude for blessings received.

**Fellowship**. Maintaining and restoring communion with God and the covenant community.

**Seeking Favor**. Approaching God to petition for needs.

#### The Ritual Process

Bringing an offering was a serious and structured event:

**Bringing Offering**. The worshiper would bring their offering (an unblemished animal, grain, etc.) into the appropriate Temple court.

**Approaching Altar**. They would approach the Altar in the Court of the Priests.

**Inspection & Ritual**. Priests officiated the process: inspecting the offering, performing the necessary ritual actions (like laying on of hands by the worshiper for animal sacrifices, slaughtering, manipulating the blood against the altar, burning specific portions on the altar fire).

**High Importance**. This act of presenting an offering at the altar was considered one of the most sacred duties and privileges. It was the prescribed way to draw near to God, deal with sin, express devotion, and maintain one's standing within the covenant community. It was a tangible expression of faith and repentance.

### What could stop this ritual of worship?

#### Requirements & Readiness

**Ritual Purity**. Uncleanness barred access. If someone realized they had contracted ritual impurity (e.g., contact with a dead body, certain bodily discharges - see Leviticus 11-15, Numbers 19), they would first need to undergo the prescribed purification rituals, before they could proceed with their offering. 

**Unsatisfactory Offering**. If the offering itself was found to be blemished or unsuitable according to the specific requirements of the Law for that type of offering, it would be rejected. The worshiper would need to procure a proper offering.

**Prescribed Order**. The rituals themselves had a specific order. A worshiper couldn't just rush to the altar; they had to follow the steps mediated by the priesthood.

**Unrepented Sin**. While the ritual system itself focused heavily on correct procedure and purity, the prophets had long emphasized that God rejected sacrifices offered by those who were simultaneously living in gross injustice, idolatry, or rebellion without repentance ([`Isaiah 1:11-17`](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1.htm#11); [`Jeremiah 7:21-23`](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7.htm#21); [`Amos 5:21-24`](https://biblehub.com/amos/5.htm#21); [`Micah 6:6-8`](https://biblehub.com/micah/6.htm#6)). 

### What new requirement does Jesus offer?

#### Go Be Reconciled

> [`Matthew 9:13`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm). I desire mercy, not sacrifice. Also [`Hosea 6:6`](https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm)

**Reconciliation**. Jesus suggest that relational reconciliation takes absolute priority over religious ritual.

#### Significance

**Relationships**. God values restored human relationships more than religious rituals performed while relationships remain broken.

> [`Mark 11:25`](https://biblehub.com/mark/11-25.htm) If you hold anything against anyone, forgive him.

**Impact**. Our horizontal relationship (person-to-person) directly impacts our vertical relationship (person-to-God).

> [`1 John 4:20`](https://biblehub.com/1john/4-20.htm) If anyone says, 'I love God,' yet hates his brother, he is a liar.

## What happens when you don't reconcile?

> [`Matthew 5:25-26`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5.htm#25) Reconcile quickly with your adversary, while you are still on the way to court. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

> [`Romans 12:18`](https://biblehub.com/romans/12-18.htm). If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone." (The goal of peaceful relationships).

### Settling Out of Court

!!! example "Illustration"   
    
    Jesus uses a practical, everyday example of someone being taken to court by an adversary (accuser). He tells us that we would be better off settling out of court (cost, time, & some control over the outcome).
    
> [`Proverbs 25:8`](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-8.htm). Do not bring hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame?" (Advises settling disputes).

**Progressive Consequences**. Here's the breakdown of the process He describes:

1. **on the way to court**. This is the initial stage, *before* any formal legal action has been taken. The "adversary" (Greek: *antidikos* - opponent in a lawsuit) is someone who has a claim or grievance against you. "In the way with him" literally means while you are walking together, perhaps on the road *to* the magistrate or court, or simply while you still have the opportunity for direct, private interaction before escalating the matter.

    - **reconcile quickly**. This means negotiating, compromising, apologizing, making restitution – whatever is necessary to resolve the dispute privately and amicably between the two parties involved. The goal is to prevent the conflict from entering the formal legal system.

2. **to the judge**. If you fail to "reconcile quickly" during the "out of court" phase, the adversary proceeds with formal legal action. They bring the complaint before the designated authority – the "judge" (Greek: *kritēs*). This moves the dispute from a private matter to a public, legal one.

    - **Shift in Control**. At this point, you lose direct control over the resolution. The power to decide the outcome now rests with the judge, an impartial (in theory) third party. The adversary is no longer someone you can simply negotiate with; they are presenting their case for a formal ruling.

3. **to the officer**. The judge makes a ruling. If the judgment goes against you (e.g., you are found liable for a debt or guilty of an offense requiring payment or penalty), the judge doesn't personally enforce the sentence. Instead, the judge hands you over (delivers you) to the appropriate enforcement agent – the "officer" (Greek: *hypēretēs* - attendant, servant, often used for court officials, bailiffs, or guards).

    - **Formal Enforcement**. The judge's decision is formalized. The officer is now legally authorized and responsible for carrying out the sentence decreed by the judge. This could involve seizing property, collecting a fine, or, as mentioned next, imprisonment.

4.  **to prison**. This is the final stage in the scenario Jesus presents. The officer carries out the judge's sentence by imprisoning the person who failed to settle earlier. In that era, imprisonment was often used for debtors until the debt was paid (sometimes by relatives or friends), not necessarily just for criminals as we might primarily think today.

    - **Physical confinement**. The person loses their freedom as a direct consequence of the legal judgment. Jesus adds in the next verse (v. 26) the severity: "Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing." This emphasizes the potentially inescapable and complete nature of the consequence once this stage is reached.

**The Deeper Meaning**. While describing a literal process, Jesus uses this as an analogy for spiritual matters:

*   **The Adversary:** Can represent someone we have wronged, or ultimately, God, against whom we have sinned.
*   **"In the Way":** Represents our current life – the time we have *now* to get right with others and with God.
*   **"Agree Quickly":** Represents repentance, seeking forgiveness, making amends, and reconciling relationships *before* it's too late.
*   **Judge, Officer, Prison:** Represent the process of divine judgment and its inescapable consequences for unresolved sin and broken relationships.

Jesus' point is one of **urgency**. He is stressing the critical importance of dealing with conflict, guilt, and relational breaches *immediately* – both horizontally (with other people) and vertically (with God) – to avoid far more severe and potentially irreversible consequences later on (i.e., judgment). He connects this directly to his teachings on anger and the need for reconciliation before even attempting religious acts like offering sacrifices (Matthew 5:23-24).

1. You accuser may hand you over to the Judge.
2. The judge may hand you over to an officer.
3. The officer will throw you into prison. 
4. You'll remain in prison until your debt is paid.

**No Leniency**. The imprisonment described is not lenient; full payment is required (stay until you have paid the last penny). 

**Spiritual Parallel**. While this has a literal application to legal and financial disputes, it strongly implies a spiritual parallel. Unresolved sin and conflict (stemming from the anger mentioned earlier) have severe consequences before God, the ultimate Judge. Failing to seek reconciliation carries a heavy spiritual cost.

> [`Luke 12:57-59`](https://biblehub.com/luke/12.htm#57). A very close parallel passage, emphasizing the same urgency.

> [`Matthew 18:21-35`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/18.htm#21). The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant, showing the severe consequences of failing to extend mercy/forgiveness after receiving it from God.

## Key Theological Themes

1. **Internal Righteousness**. God judges the heart, not just external actions
2. **Authority of Jesus**. He claims authority to interpret and deepen the Law
3. **Relationship Priority**. Reconciled relationships precede acceptable worship
4. **Urgency**. Time for dealing with sin and seeking reconciliation is limited

## Application Points

1. Examine your heart for attitudes of anger, resentment, or contempt toward others
2. Take the initiative to seek reconciliation, even when you believe you're not at fault
3. Prioritize healthy relationships over religious activities or rituals
4. Address conflicts quickly and directly before they escalate
5. Recognize that your words reveal the condition of your heart
6. Remember that your relationship with God is connected to your relationships with others

## Reflection Questions

1. In what areas of your life might you be focusing on external obedience while neglecting heart attitudes?
2. Is there anyone with whom you need to seek reconciliation before continuing in worship?
3. How do you typically respond when someone offends you? Do you harbor anger or seek reconciliation?
4. How might your speech reveal contempt for others? What words do you use that devalue people made in God's image?
5. What practical steps can you take today to reconcile a broken relationship?
6. What is the difference between righteous indignation and sinful anger? How can you discern between them?
7. How does Jesus' teaching here challenge cultural attitudes about conflict resolution?
8. In what ways might church practices today inadvertently prioritize ritual over reconciliation?
