### Review (Jesus & the Law)

Jesus did not come to **ABOLISH** the Law, but rather to **FULFILL** the Law.

### Icebreaker
!!! question "Discussion Question"   
    What's the difference between being angry and expressing anger? Is one more acceptable than the other?
    
    When you were really angry with someone but managed to hold back from saying or doing something hurtful. What helped you control your anger in that moment, and how did you feel afterward?

### Passage

!!! quote "Matthew 5:21-26, BSB"
    **21** You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ 
    
    **22** But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.
    
    **23** Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, **24** leave your gift there in front of altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.
    
    **25** Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. **26** Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

### Context

Jesus has stated that He did not come to abolish the Law but to fulfill it, and that our righteousness must exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees (5:17-20). Now, Jesus provides the first of six **antitheses** where He contrasts the traditional understanding ("*You have heard it said...*") with His more complete interpretation ("*But I say to you...*").

## 1. The Sixth Commandment

> [`Matthew 5:21`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-21.htm). You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'Do not murder' and 'Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.'

### What is the traditional understanding?

**Decalogue**. Jesus references specifically the Decalogue (or 10 Commandments) and more generally all the judicial guidelines related to the sixth command in the Law. 

When we typically hear the sixth commandment, it goes like this: *Thou shall not kill*, but the Hebrew term is more specific and refers to unlawful, intentional killing with malice.

> [`Exodus 20:13`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-13.htm). Do not murder. Also [`Deuteronomy 5:17`](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-17.htm).

!!! info "Murder"   
    (Heb. ratsach). murder, slay with premeditation and evil intent.

### What are other forms of killing?

- **Manslaughter**. Killing someone *unintentionally*, without prior hatred or planning. Intent is a critical factor when determining if the killing is considered murder. ([`Numbers 35:12`](https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm))
- **Capital punishment**. The Law prescribed the *death penalty* for certain offenses, including premeditated murder, kidnapping, adultery, and blasphemy. These state-sanctioned executions, carried out after due process (requiring witnesses, judgment) were not considered murder. ([`Exodus 21:12`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-12.htm), [`Exodus 21:16`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-16.htm))
- **Warfare**. Wars commanded or permitted by God (*national defense*) involved killing but were generally understood within a different framework than personal, unlawful murder. ([`Deuteronomy 7:1-2`](https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7.htm), [`1 Samuel 15:1-3`](https://biblehub.com/1samuel/15.htm))
- **Self-defense**. Killing a *thief* breaking into one's house at night. ([`Exodus 22:2`](https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-2.htm))

### Why is murder prohibited?

- **Value of Human Life**. Human life is sacred because people are created in the _image of God_ (Genesis 1:27).
- **Attack on God**. Taking a human life is not just an assault on the individual but on the God in whose image they are made.

### What are the consequences of murder?

> [`Genesis 9:6`](https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm). Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed.

- **Established Principle**. This verse, given after the Flood long before the Mosaic Law, establishes the principle: taking a life made in God's image demands the forfeiture of the killer's life as a just consequence.
- **Capital Punishment**. The penalty for proven murder was death. There was no possibility of substitution or paying a ransom (Numbers 35:31). The principle of *lex talionis* ("life for life" - Exodus 21:23-24) applied directly here.
- **Bloodguilt**. Unavenged murder was believed to pollute the land where the community lived (Numbers 35:33-34). The land could only be cleansed by the blood (execution) of the one who shed innocent blood.

## 2. A New Interpretation

> [`Matthew 5:22`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm). But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be subject to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be subject to the fire of hell.

### But I tell you...
    
Jesus claims authority equal to or greater than the traditional interpretation of the Law. He shifts the focus from the *outward act* of murder to the *internal attitude* that precedes it.

### What is the root of murder?

- [`Genesis 4:5-8`](https://biblehub.com/genesis/4.htm). Cain's anger preceded his murder of Abel.
- [`1 John 3:15`](https://biblehub.com/1john/3-15.htm). Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer.

**Anger**. The same root of *malice* and *disregard* for the value of another human being that leads to **physical murder** is present in _unrighteous anger_, _contemptuous speech_ (Raca), and *condemning judgment* (You fool!). 

While the Old Testament Law primarily dealt with the _external act_, Jesus revealed that God judges the _internal attitude_ with equal seriousness. He connects these heart issues to judgment, even the _fire of hell_. He wasn't lessening the gravity of physical murder; He was elevating the gravity of the internal sins that are its root.

Being angry with a brother _without cause_ or with simmering _resentment_ makes one subject to judgment.

- [`Ephesians 4:26-27`](https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4.htm). Be angry, yet do not sin.
- [`James 1:19-20`](https://biblehub.com/james/1.htm). Man's anger does not bring about the righteousness that God desires.

### How does anger escalate?

Jesus describes how internal anger manifests verbally with increasing severity:

| Expression | Meaning | Consequence |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Anger** | Internal hostility | Subject to judgment |
| **Raca** | Showing contempt for intellect/worth | Subject to the Sanhedrin (highest Jewish court) |
| **You fool!** | Implying moral and spiritual deficiency (Psalm 14:1) | Subject to the fire of hell (Gehenna) |

- [`Proverbs 12:18`](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-18.htm). The words of the reckless pierce like swords.
- [`Matthew 12:36-37`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/12.htm#36). Men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word.
- [`James 3:6-10`](https://biblehub.com/james/3.htm#6). The destructive power of the tongue.

!!! info "Raca"   
    (Grk. rhaka). from an Aramaic term meaning empty-headed, worthless.
    
    An expression of profound *contempt* and *dismissal*. It attacks a person's intelligence and inherent worth, essentially saying, "You are nothing; your opinion/existence doesn't matter.

!!! info "Sanhedrin"   
    The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish judicial council in Jerusalem, composed of 71 members (elders, chief priests, scribes). It dealt with the most serious religious and legal matters.
    
    Jesus isn't necessarily saying that the Sanhedrin would literally prosecute someone for using this term. Rather, He's using the highest human court as a *benchmark for the seriousness* of the offense in God's eyes.

> [`Psalm 14:1`](https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm). The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'

!!! info "You Fool!"   
    (Gr. mōros). dull, stupid; to imply moral and spiritual deficiency, godlessness. 
    
    This word from which we get the word _moron_ carries a heavier weight than just intellectual deficiency. It implies *moral and spiritual* deficiency. 

**Fire of Hell**. Jesus indicates that this kind of condemnatory speech reflects a heart condition that is so severely opposed to God's love and judgment that it aligns the speaker with those deserving eternal punishment. 

**My Judgment**. When we label someone as a moral and spiritual reprobate, we usurp God's role as judge and express a level of malice and condemnation that originates from a heart condition worthy of hell itself.

## 3. At the Altar

> [`Matthew 5:23-24`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5.htm#21) So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.

### What is the significance?

**Act of Worship**. The Temple in Jerusalem, and specifically its altar(s), was the designated center of Israel's worship life according to the Mosaic Covenant. Bringing offerings was not optional for a devout Jew; it was a commanded means of relating to God.

#### Types of Offerings

The _gift_ (Greek: *dōron*) could refer to various types of offerings (Leviticus 1-7):
- **Sacrifices for Atonement**. Sin Offerings (*chattat*) and Guilt Offerings (*asham*) were crucial for dealing with unintentional sins and specific trespasses.
- **Fellowship & Thanksgiving**. Peace Offerings (*shelamim*), which included thanksgiving offerings, vow offerings, and freewill offerings.
- **Dedication & Homage**. Burnt Offerings (*olah*) and Grain Offerings (*minchah*).
- **Other Gifts**. Tithes and firstfruits.

#### Purpose & Meaning

- **Obedience**. Fulfilling God's commands in the Law.
- **Atonement**. Seeking forgiveness and cleansing from sin.
- **Worship**. Expressing reverence, adoration, and homage to God.
- **Thanksgiving**. Showing gratitude for blessings received.
- **Fellowship**. Maintaining and restoring communion with God and the covenant community.
- **Seeking Favor**. Approaching God to petition for needs.

#### The Ritual Process

Bringing an offering was a serious and structured event. This act of presenting an offering at the altar was considered one of the most sacred duties and privileges.

### What could stop this ritual of worship?
- **Ritual Purity**. Uncleanness barred access.
- **Unsatisfactory Offering**. A blemished offering would be rejected.
- **Prescribed Order**. The rituals themselves had a specific order.
- **Unrepented Sin**. The prophets had long emphasized that God rejected sacrifices offered by those living in injustice or rebellion ([`Isaiah 1:11-17`](https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1.htm#11); [`Amos 5:21-24`](https://biblehub.com/amos/5.htm#21)). 

### What new requirement does Jesus offer?

#### Go Be Reconciled
> [`Matthew 9:13`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm). I desire mercy, not sacrifice. Also [`Hosea 6:6`](https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm)

**Reconciliation**. Jesus suggest that relational reconciliation takes absolute priority over religious ritual.

#### Significance

- **Relationships**. God values restored human relationships more than religious rituals performed while relationships remain broken. ([`Mark 11:25`](https://biblehub.com/mark/11-25.htm))
- **Impact**. Our horizontal relationship (person-to-person) directly impacts our vertical relationship (person-to-God). ([`1 John 4:20`](https://biblehub.com/1john/4-20.htm))

## 4. What happens when you don't reconcile?

> [`Matthew 5:25-26`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5.htm#25) Reconcile quickly with your adversary, while you are still on the way to court. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

> [`Romans 12:18`](https://biblehub.com/romans/12-18.htm). If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone." (The goal of peaceful relationships).

### Settling Out of Court

!!! example "Illustration"   
    Jesus uses a practical, everyday example of someone being taken to court by an adversary (accuser). He tells us that we would be better off settling out of court (cost, time, & some control over the outcome).
    
> [`Proverbs 25:8`](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-8.htm). Do not bring hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame?" (Advises settling disputes).

**Progressive Consequences**. Here's the breakdown of the process He describes:
1. **on the way to court**. The initial stage, *before* formal legal action. You still have an opportunity for direct, private interaction.
2. **to the judge**. If you fail to reconcile, the matter moves from private to public. You lose direct control.
3. **to the officer**. The judge's ruling is formalized, and an officer is authorized to carry out the sentence.
4.  **to prison**. The final stage. You lose your freedom as a direct consequence.

**The Deeper Meaning**. While describing a literal process, Jesus uses this as an analogy for spiritual matters:
-   **The Adversary:** Can represent someone we have wronged, or ultimately, God, against whom we have sinned.
-   **"In the Way":** Represents our current life – the time we have *now* to get right with others and with God.
-   **"Agree Quickly":** Represents repentance, seeking forgiveness, and making amends *before* it's too late.
-   **Judge, Officer, Prison:** Represent the process of divine judgment and its inescapable consequences.

Jesus' point is one of **urgency**. He is stressing the critical importance of dealing with conflict, guilt, and relational breaches *immediately*.

**No Leniency**. The imprisonment described is not lenient; full payment is required. 

**Spiritual Parallel**. Unresolved sin and conflict have severe consequences before God, the ultimate Judge. Failing to seek reconciliation carries a heavy spiritual cost. ([`Luke 12:57-59`](https://biblehub.com/luke/12.htm#57), [`Matthew 18:21-35`](https://biblehub.com/matthew/18.htm#21))

## Key Theological Themes

1. **Internal Righteousness**. God judges the heart, not just external actions.
2. **Authority of Jesus**. He claims authority to interpret and deepen the Law.
3. **Relationship Priority**. Reconciled relationships precede acceptable worship.
4. **Urgency**. Time for dealing with sin and seeking reconciliation is limited.

## Application Points

1. Examine your heart for attitudes of anger, resentment, or contempt toward others.
2. Take the initiative to seek reconciliation, even when you believe you're not at fault.
3. Prioritize healthy relationships over religious activities or rituals.
4. Address conflicts quickly and directly before they escalate.
5. Recognize that your words reveal the condition of your heart.
6. Remember that your relationship with God is connected to your relationships with others.
