# Character. Contentment
**Passage**. Philippians 4:10–20

DEFINING CONTENTMENT
Contentment is a noun defined as “feelings
of happiness in one’s situation in life.”
Defining contentment is helpful, but knowing
its antonym—discontentment—is even
more beneficial. Discontentment can be
defined as a noun, verb, or adjective. As a
noun, discontent “describes a restless desire
or craving for something one does not have.”
As a verb, discontent is to “make dissatisfied,
displeased.” As an adjective, discontent means
showing or experiencing dissatisfaction, a
restless longing for something better.

CONTENTMENT IN THE MIND
In Paul’s letter to the Philippians, he wrote,
“Finally brothers and sisters, whatever is
true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just,
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
commendable—if there is any moral excellence
and if there is anything praiseworthy—dwell
on these things” (Phil. 4:8). Just a few verses
later, Paul spoke about how he had learned
contentment. Perhaps Paul learned that the state
of contentment was related to the command he
delivered to the church of what to dwell on.

CONTENTMENT IN SPEECH
Colossians 4:6 reminds us that our speech is
to be seasoned with salt. How you speak to
and about people is critical for the discipline
of contentment. If you are quick to criticize
and have difficulty speaking graciously with
others, the seeds of discontentment will flourish.
However, you practice contentment by letting
all your speech be gracious. A good experiment
would be to set one day aside and commit to
only speaking well and graciously of others in
person and on social media.

CONTENTMENT IN CHRIST
One of the reasons Paul stressed his learned
contentment was that he was celebrating the
concern and care the Philippian church had for
him. The catch is he was celebrating from prison.
While he was confined, the walls around him did
not imprison his identity. His identity was fixed
in Christ, not his circumstances. Dream of doing
big things for God but refuse to wed who you are
with what does or does not get accomplished.
