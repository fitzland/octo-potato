# My Thoughts on the Bible Study

Current Study: Godliness (1 Timothy 4:6-16) Point others to Christ

## Introduction

### Icebreaker
In the icebreaker we set up two concepts: religious and godly. 
We might believe them to be similar but they have subtle differences. 
What are the differences? 
We define *religious* as following a set of external rules and rituals. These are often performed without heart change. Somethinge we HAVE to do.
We define *godly* as an internal orientation towards pursuing and pleasing God. Something we WANT to do.
Can you be one without the other?
YES. Obviously we could. But I should note that this is not intended to discount discipline (which could look very similar to the character quality of religious).
It might be through discipline that our hearts turn towards God moment by moment, as we spend time with Him in his word, or practice a time of confession through prayer.
I think these things are possible. But I suppose that ultimately the gospel (we are sinners, saved by grace) is what turns our hearts towards Him and godliness.

### Historical Context
I think this is good and explains well the purpose for Paul's writing.

### Modern Context
One point here that needs some extra thought. Above we have defined religous as following a set of rules without heart change.
Here we contrast spiritual and religious. Has the definition of religious changed in this context. 
Above it seemed like we were saying we should seek godly traits over religious traits.
Now we are possibly lifting up religious ideas over spiritual ideas. 
I might need more clarity on this shift in understanding or how we define these terms.
Otherwise, I think it is good to focus on the idea of abstaining from spiritual junk food, and focusing in on the hope of the gospel (we are SINNERS, SAVED by grace).

## Godly Life is Priority
Agree. We reject spiritual distractions and actively train ourselves for a life that reflects God.
I really like the way this section is constructed. There is not a lot of overlap in the CONTEXT & INSIGHTS and the DISCUSSION QUESTION. 
We establish a situation: there are religious myths out there. These can be a hindrance to godly lives.
It's not a check box that makes us godly, but still we are called to actively pursue godliness.
I would say this can be done by practicing the presence of God; we must be in God's presence. 
Example. Should I go to the nursing home to visit grandma? On the one hand it's a hassle. I have better things to do with my time, like something that brings me joy (I think).
But, I will never get to know grandma deeply, if I don't spend time with her. What seems like a chore, is really good for me and could bring joy to both our spirits.
In a way, I think this type of thinking is reflective of the Prosperity Gospel—I'm thinking about what I get out of this.
Regarding, spiritual vs. physical training, I would say it's better to be fat and godly, than religious and trim. 

### Pointless Myths (Discussion:Mind)
I love these. 
The real problem with 'Be True to Yourself' is that 'yourself' is sinful—there is NONE that is righteous, not even one.
I think I'm seeing the direction of 'Spiritual but not Religious' and I agree in concept, but again I think it is confusing with the terms as defined in places.
In the icebreaker we would lean away from being religious, and here we are saying that it's a problem when something is spiritual without religion.
We just need to be a little tighter or provide more clarity on this terminology.
Nothing wrong with activism, but more than likely it can become check box spirituality—I'm trying to earn my righteousness.

### Training Regimen (Reflection:Heart)
I like this question. It asks me to think about my priorities. And this section is about pointing us to a godly priority. Perfect.

## Godly Life Grounded in Hope
Let me come back to this later.
