# Task: Lesson Style Distillation

## Goal
To analyze the differences between a generated Bible study lesson and a user-edited version to extract precise stylistic, structural, and pedagogical preferences. This "distilled DNA" will be used to update the project's standard task and style guides to ensure all future lessons match the user's perfected format.

## Inputs
1.  **Original File:** The version generated by the assistant (e.g., `*-ORIGINAL.md`).
2.  **Edited File:** The version manually refined by the user.

## Process

### 1. Structural Analysis
- Compare the heading hierarchy. Did the user consolidate sections or add new ones?
- Look at the "Lesson Flow" and "Series Overview" tables. Did the user change the columns, wording, or density?

### 2. Pedagogical Logic (The Socratic Shift)
- **Question Phrasing:** How were the questions reworded? Look for patterns: Does the user prefer shorter questions? More personal "you" questions? Questions that point more strictly to the text?
- **Insight Handling:** Analyze the "Anticipated Answers" (the bolded text after blockquotes). Did the user prune theological jargon, add specific types of historical hooks, or change the "insight-to-question" ratio?
- **Scannability:** Identify what makes the edited version easier to "scan while teaching." Look for specific bolding patterns, bullet usage, or the removal of "filler" words.

### 3. Tone and Voice
- Analyze the transitions. Did the user make them more conversational, more direct, or more formal?
- Compare the "Synthesis" and "Introduction" sections. How did the user adjust the "hook" to better fit their teaching voice?

### 4. Technical Formatting
- Check for precise punctuation and spacing rules (e.g., placement of periods relative to bolding, use of italics for specific teacher instructions, or specific BSB citation formats).

## Expected Output
1.  **Style Delta Report:** A concise list of "Lessons Learned" from the comparison (e.g., "User prefers 1-sentence insights," "User removes all leading articles in headings").
2.  **Proposed Updates:** Specific additions or modifications to `style-bible-study.md` or `task-bible-study-prep.md` to lock in these preferences.
